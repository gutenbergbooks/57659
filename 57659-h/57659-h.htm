<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<p>This Foreword, were it not for the tyrant Custom,
might as well be omitted, since a preface is seldom
read. Boldly I make my first appearance before the
critical public with no excuses to offer and no apology
to the reader for adding another volume to the long
list of travel books in the English tongue. But I have
reasons why I have ventured into print.</p>

<p>First,—Iceland has a fascination for all who know it.
Its history, its ancient and modern literature, its legends
and folklore, the people with their customs of a thousand
years unchanged, the magnificence and grandeur
of its scenery, its bird and plant life, its unexcelled
opportunities for the student of geology,—all these
and many more, are reasons why all the English speaking
people should know something of this ancient
branch of the Gothic line from which time and circumstance
have separated the Angle and the Saxon.</p>

<p>Second,—There is little or nothing in the English
language that is authoritative concerning present conditions
in Iceland. Henderson, publishing in 1819, and
Miss Oswald in 1882, are the only writers in English
who have given to the public a fair and appreciative
story of Iceland and its people. True it is that there
are a few brief works, mainly the accounts of a sojourn
of two or possibly three weeks in the country, but they
are of necessity limited in scope of observation and lacking
in appreciation of real conditions. A character
study of the conservative Icelander may not be completed
in a single season, one must live with him to know
him.</p>

<p>Third,—The kindness with which my numerous lectures
on Iceland have been received by the public and
the manifest lack of any definite knowledge concerning
this country and its people have led me to place before
the public this straightforward, simple tale about the
Icelanders with some descriptions of their fascinating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
land. It is the result of extended travels during the
summers of 1909, 1910, 1911 and 1913 through the
well known sections and in the out-of-the-way places as
well as the unknown portions.</p>

<p>I desire to make the following acknowledgments:—I
have both Henderson and Miss Oswald to thank for
my first interest and their observations and remarks have
ever been in my mind for a comparison with my own
experiences. My thanks are due to many Icelanders, to
all those who unselfishly opened their doors that I
might share their hospitality, more especially to those
who in kindness answered my numerous questions, often
quite personal, about their countrymen and customs,—in
particular do I mention Helgi Zoëga, who has been
untiring in furnishing ponies, provisions and sound advice;
Steffán Steffánson, who has written many lengthy
letters in answer to inquiries; Ólafur Eyvindsson, my
friend and trusty guide, whose name frequently occurs
in these pages and Dr. Geir T. Zoëga, First Master of
the Latin School at Reykjavik, for his advice and
council. Finally, I acknowledge my indebtedness to her,
to whom this volume is dedicated, for her kindly criticism
of these pages while in progress of composition
and for the final reading and examination of proofs.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott has said in reference to one of his
poetical works:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“…, though scarce my skill command</div>
<div class="verse">Some feeble echoing of thine earlier lay,</div>
<div class="verse">Though harsh and faint and soon to die away,—</div>
<div class="verse center">…</div>
<div class="verse">Yet if one heart throb higher at its sway,</div>
<div class="verse">The wizard note has not been touched in vain.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And so I say,—if one person acquires an interest in
Iceland and its noble people, its history and its ancient
tales,—this labor has not been in vain.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Atossa.</i>—And who is set over them as a shepherd of the flock, and is
master of the army?</p>

either.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Historically, Iceland is unique. Assyria,
Egypt, Greece, Italy, Mexico,—each
has a prehistoric period of human
habitation, when man loved and hated,
and competed with the brutes for existence. He fashioned
his instruments from stone and made self-preservation
his first and only law. A sturdy race, little removed
from the highest brutes, filled with animal vigor
and endowed with brute passions, held all known lands
in prehistoric time. Step by step, cycle upon cycle,
brute force submitted to reason; culture and refinement,
mental acquisition and spiritual attainment characterized
an evolutionary race of human beings in which each
developing cycle was founded upon the decadence of the
prehistoric.</p>

<p>Not so with Iceland. A myriad centuries the Atlantic
had rolled its billows against these basalt cliffs, the
Arctic packed its ice upon these shores, the beetling
mountains cast their rugged outlines upon the quiet
fiords, the great Plutonic candles flamed in the Arctic air
and guttered the land again and again with scorching
streams of molten rock. The seal basked in the
sunshine of the lengthened summer, the salmon
sported in the glacial streams and millions of birds congregated
on the lofty cliffs. All life was blissfully ignorant
of its great enemy, man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>There are no prehistoric conditions in Iceland.</p>

<p>The men who settled Iceland were neither serf nor
savage. They were men of might and power, fearless
and of high birth and of the highest mental capacity
in the ancient days of Norway. The cause of their emigration
is related by Snorri in <i>Heimskringla</i>. Halfdan,
the Black, was one of the petty kings of Norway. At his
death, he left his realm to Harald, a child of ten years,
known in history as The Fair Haired.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is to the influence
of a high-minded woman, Gyda, daughter of
Eric, King of Hordaland, that the settlement of Iceland
by the nobles of Scandinavia is due. Harald sent his
messengers to Gyda with the request that she become
his wife. To their demand she replied,—</p>

<p>“I will not waste my maidenhood for the taking to
husband of a king who has no more realm to rule over
than a few folks. Marvelous it seems to me that there
be no king minded to make Norway his own and be sole
lord thereof in such wise as Gorm of Denmark or Eric
of Upsala have done.”</p>

<p>Her reply in no way angered Harald. On the contrary
he praised her high spirit and said,—</p>

<p>“For she has brought to my mind that matter which
it now seems to me wondrous I have not had in my
mind before.”</p>

<p>He then made the following oath,—</p>

<p>“This oath I make fast, and swear before that God
who made me and who rules over all things, that nevermore
will I cut my hair or comb it, till I have gotten to
me all Norway, with the scat thereof and the dues, and
all rule thereover, or else I will die rather.”</p>

<p>After years of strenuous warfare he brought all Norway
under his rule, wedded Gyda and held a feast.
Snorri completes the story as follows,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“So King Harald took a bath, and then he let his hair
be combed, and then Earl Rognavald sheared it. And
heretofore it had been uncombed and unshorn for ten
winters. Aforetime he had been called Shock-head, but
now Earl Rognavald gave him a by-name and called him
Harald Fair Haired, and all said who saw him that he
was most soothly named, for he had both plenteous hair
and goodly.”</p>

<p>Harald lived from 860 to 933 A. D. He introduced
that new doctrine of middle Europe that made the people
the king’s retainers at all times and not on special
occasions. It was a centralization and consolidation of
power and royal authority. It laid taxes upon all the
lands and interfered with what the people had ever held
as their vested rights. It enabled the monarch to meddle
with the holdings of his people and aimed to cement
the entire country into one kingdom of power through
a central head rather than to permit the existence of
several petty realms, each presided over by a Jarl who
was jealous of his more powerful neighbors. To the
lesser rulers the course of Harald was tyrannical, a
curse upon their freedom, a blight upon their ambition.
As we view the situation from the distance of ten
centuries, it was a step in the progress of the nations
that was to result in a blessing through the introduction
of Christianity and the ultimate progress of civilization.
The freemen resisted as long as they could;
beaten again and again they gathered their waning
strength and renewed the desperate struggle, but to no
purpose. One by one the freeholders came under Harald’s
dominion. Many withdrew from the scene of
strife, forsook the land of their birth, preferring exile
with their accustomed liberties to vassalage under conditions,
where, as they deemed, no free-born man would
care to live.</p>

<p>We now read of them in many lands. France, Italy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Spain,—each in turn feels the fury of the wrath of the
fair-haired warriors of the north. A century later, we
behold these restless wanderers victorious in the streets
of Byzantium. They check their foes from whatever
source they come, never give quarter and swiftly ride
to victory, be it on their spirited chargers or in their
high-prowed seahorses. In Sicily, Asia, the shores of the
Black Sea, in Greece, in northern Africa, no matter
where, the stoutest champions of the Moslem or the
less valiant warriors of the declining Roman Empire,
all feel the force of the northern blast and succumb to
the prowess of the Northmen. Wherever they go they
leave their mark, and to this day the arsenal of Venice
is scored with runes which boast the triumphs of the
Vikings.</p>

<p>Of all their wanderings the islands “west-over-the-sea”
were their chosen field for conquest. For centuries
the coast and river hamlets of England, Scotland and
Ireland were in constant dread of their bloody depredations.
Their blows were quickly struck. Whence they
came the Briton did not know. Swift as the hawk upon
the sparrow, they swept down upon some quiet, industrious
hamlet with merciless weapon in hand. Fire,
pillage and slaughter followed in their wake. They
plundered home and sanctuary, tossed in sport the
screaming children on their pikes, sent their mothers to
shame and serfdom, and left the erstwhile peaceful
Briton to quench the ebbing stream of life in the smouldering
embers of his former home.</p>

<p>Ireland, where a civilization, greater than we shall
ever know, was crumbling, lured them to mingle in the
strife between its petty lords, from which the Vikings
always issued with the lion’s share of the spoil and glory.
Scotland, and its adjacent islands, offered tempting
chances for swift descent upon unprotected hamlets;
and in the hours of their rest or preparation for a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
onslaught, its channels afforded them protection and
opportunity to refit their ships. The blow struck and
they were away with seahorse laden to the water’s edge,
seeking the security of the Orkneys, the Shetlands and
the distant lava peaks of Faroe. These island groups
ultimately became the homes of those who dared not
return to Norway or had become too aged to mingle
longer in the robbery of Europe. From these islands
the self-exiled Northmen sailed forth to assist now one
faction of England, Scotland and Ireland, and now
another, and even vented their spite by continued bold
and dastardly forays upon the domains of Harald.</p>

<p>In 860 Naddodd, a Faroe Viking, left his native
Isles and was driven by contrary winds deep into the
stormy waters of the north. For days no land was visible,
and the anxious eye beheld only the boundless waste
of waters shrouded in impenetrable fogs, and the occasional
glimpses were only of the rolling, drift-strewn
sea ever beyond. At length, the mists were lifted, and
the plucky mariner beheld the snow-capped peaks of
Iceland. A landing was effected but Naddodd found
no traces of human beings, and in his deep disgust he
christened the newly discovered country Snaeland, immediately
taking his departure.</p>

<p>In 864 Gardar, a Swedish Viking, in attempting to
reach the Hebrides, was driven by adverse winds, as
Naddodd had been, and at length reached Iceland. He
explored the coast quite thoroughly and was the first
to circumnavigate it. He built a house on the shore of
<i>Skjalfandifjörðr</i>, the present site of <i>Húsavik</i>, “house-by-the-creek.”
Hoping to affix his name to the country,
he rechristened it Gardar’s Holm. On his return to
the Hebrides he gave an enthusiastic account of his voyage
and discoveries.</p>

<p>This story so influenced Floki Vilgerdarson, a famous
old Viking, that he resolved at once to settle in the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
country. Floki, trusting to the flight of ravens, took
three of these sable birds of omen as his pilots. When
a little beyond the Faroe Islands, he liberated one bird
which immediately returned to the land. Some days
later a second was set free, whereupon it arose, circled
about the ship and returned to its cage. Later the
third was liberated. This bird flew to the northwest,
and piloted Floki to Iceland. On entering a great bay,
bounded on the right by a lofty mountain and on the
left by a rugged promontory, Faxa, one of his companions,
called the attention of Floki to the fact that
such prominent physical features must mark a land of
vast expansion and enormous riches. So flattered was
Floki that the bay was immediately christened <i>Faxafjörðr</i>,
its present name. A colony was founded on
a small inlet which in honor of their feathered pilot
was named <i>Hrafnarfjörðr</i>, “Raven’s fiord.” Proper
precaution was not taken for the severe winter that followed,
and during the second year the few survivors returned
to Faroe in disgust and gave to this inhospitable
land the chilly name of <i>Iceland</i>.</p>

<p>Among the first of the high-born Jarls of Norway to
leave his native land was Ingölfr Arnarson, accompanied
by his foster brother, Hjörleifr. Many of his
friends had gone to ravage France, others went to England,
where Alfred was beginning his eventful reign and
still others remained in Norway to await the reports
from Ingölfr in Iceland. This was in 874, and recalling
accounts of Gardar, they set sail with high hopes.
Ingölfr took with him the pillars of the high seat of
his ancestral hall and when he came in sight of the
icy domes of the <i>Öraefa Jökull</i> he cast the pillars into
the sea and vowed that upon whatever coast they
drifted, there would be found his colony. How many
a traveller in modern days has sailed those same waters
with the story of Ingölfr fresh in mind and gazed up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
these towering cliffs, crowned with pristine ice and decorated
with countless waterfalls glittering in the Arctic
sun!</p>

<p>A violent storm arose which separated him from
his sacred relics and forced him to land upon a long,
steep headland just under the <i>Öraefa</i>. To this day the
promontory bears the name of <i>Ingölfshöfði</i>. A still
bolder headland about seventy miles to the west bears
the name of his kinsman, <i>Hjörleifshfði</i>. Hjörleifr
was not only a sea-rover, a Viking, but he disdained to
worship the gods of his race. He set his Irish slaves
to tilling the land. They slew him and fled to the adjacent
islands, since called <i>Vestmannaeyjar</i>, or the
“Westmen Isles,” for the Irish were then known as the
Westmen.</p>

<p>Ingölfr pursued the slaves and slew them all. With
the fate of his brother in mind, who had refused to
honor the gods, Ingölfr searched vigorously for his
drifted pillars and after three years found them on
a lava-strewn fiord towards the west. A stream ran
down into the channel from a boiling spring, the steam
of which was visible for some distance. Here Ingölfr,
true to his vow, established his colony and called it
<i>Reykjavik</i>, “Smoking Creek.” One of his followers
complained of the location as follows,—</p>

<p>“Ill we did in passing the good lands to settle on
this promontory.”</p>

<p>Many people have since agreed with him that
<i>Reykjavik</i> was an unfortunate place for a settlement
and a capital. Destiny has proved too strong for reason.</p>

<p>Following these pioneers, came a steady stream of
chiefs and thralls until an event in Norway changed the
even flow of emigration into a mad rush for the new
lands in the lonely ocean. Among the sea-wolves whose
lair was in the Shetlands and the Orkneys were many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Vikings who were not content to ravage England,
France and more distant shores, but they turned to Norway
to vent their spite upon the hated Harald. The
old fire was not quenched in the blood of Norway’s
King. In 880 he came with a great host, bearing fire
and sword, determined to utterly rout the Vikings and
all their followers from their island fastnesses. He
followed his foes into creek and over cliff, wherever
sailor could go or landsman climb, from Orkney south
to the Isle of Man he put them utterly to rout and
freed forever his native lands from the pirates west-over-the-sea.</p>

<p>There was but one place left in the then known world,
whence these liberty-loving, wild and dauntless men,
driven from their haunts, could go. Harald had
taught the lesson most thoroughly; his foes were too
weak to cope with him longer. This was also a blessing
to the struggling Saxon kingdoms in England.
Thus the Vikings fled to the fire-born island in the north
Atlantic, with many a southern kinsman and many an
Irish bride.</p>

<p>Auth, daughter of Kettil the Flatnose, the queen of
Olaf the White, King of Dublin, went to Iceland in
889, as related in the <i>Erybyggja Saga</i>. She was a woman
of considerable wealth and a Christian. With her
sister Thorun, she settled in <i>Hvamn</i>. If we accept the
account of Dicuilus, an Irish monk who wrote in 829
that some of his Culdee brethren, whom the Vikings
called “Papar,” visited Iceland to secure retirement like
other anchorites, these two women were the first followers
of the Cross in the country. In 890 the women
moved from the <i>Breiðifjörðr</i> to <i>Eyjafjörðr</i>. In 1890
the Icelanders celebrated the thousandth anniversary
of the landing of the first Christians.</p>

<p>We are apt to picture the Viking as a rover of the
sea, making his war-ship fast to that of his enemy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
dealing skull-splitting strokes in a mighty mêlée, where
the shouts of the victor rose high above the clash and
clang of spear and battle-axe upon shield and helmet.
War was not his occupation nor was the sea his home.
When he wearied of the pastoral life he turned to the
sea for plunder, excitement and recreation. His wanderings
were usually of three years’ duration. As he returns
from the southern isles or the Mediterranean his
galley laden to the water’s edge with spoil, let us view
him in his real home.</p>

<p>The long ship is beached in a sheltered cove. On
the green slope reaching upwards from the shore,
stands his dwelling and around it is the <i>tún</i> or home
field enclosed with a turf covered lava wall just as one
may see it to-day in the rural districts of Iceland. If
our Viking is a man of wealth and influence he possesses
many thralls and owns a grand hall and possibly
a temple. In the center of the hall a row of fires flings
out a generous warmth while the smoke circles upwards,
glaring and spark-sprinkled, through the holes
in the roof. In the center of the long wall is the
high seat or place of honor, its lofty pillars deeply
carved and crowned with images of Thor, Odin and
Frigga. Upon the cushioned seat sits the returning
hero, his garments bound with plates of gold and his
sword, “Fire-of-the-Sea-King,” in a jewelled scabbard
by his side. A collar of engraved gold encircles
his neck and his cloak is edged with cloth of gold. On
a raised seat at one end of the hall sits his wife surrounded
by her servants, her white head dress held
with a coronet of gold mingles with her flowing hair
falling freely upon her shoulders and over her cloak
of royal blue. Her crimson gown from the far East
is girdled with golden ornaments and from her wrist
hang her keys and well filled purse.</p>

<p>Long rows of benches are occupied with friends and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
kinsmen who have come to the feast to welcome the
returning hero, who is giving a great banquet in celebration
of his victories and his safe return. The walls,
deeply carved with the stories of many conflicts in the
southern waters, are hung with trophies, shields and
weapons. The dancing firelight plays upon their burnished
surfaces. In the fitful light the house carles glide
about, bearing to the benches huge joints of roasted beef
and horse-flesh and replenishing the stoups with sparkling
mead. During the feast the scald relates in impromptu
chant with many a jest the story of the exploits
of the hero.</p>

<p>The story of the life of the early Icelander is well
told in the introduction of the <i>Burnt Njal</i> by Sir George
W. Dasent from which I quote the following:—</p>

<p>“From the cradle to the tomb the life of the Icelandic
chief fetters our attention by its poetry of will and
passion, by its fierce, untamed energy, by its patient endurance,
by its undaunted heroism. In Iceland in the
tenth century it was only healthy children that were
allowed to live. As soon as it was born the infant was
laid upon the bare ground, until the father came and
looked at it, heard and saw that it was strong in lung
and limb, its fate hung in the balance. That danger
over, it was duly washed, signed with the Thunderer’s
holy hammer, the symbol of all manliness and strength,
and solemnly received into the family as the faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
champion of the ancient gods. After the child was
named, he was often put out to foster with some neighbor,
and there he grew up with the children of the house,
and contracted those friendships and affections which
were reckoned more binding than the ties of blood. A
man was of age as soon as he was fit to do a man’s
work, as soon as he could brandish his father’s sword
and bend his bow.”</p>

<p>“But for incapacity that age had no mercy. Society
required an earnest and pledge from the man himself
that he was worth something.”</p>

<p>“Place, King!” cries a new guest to a king of Norway.</p>

<p>“Place? Find a place for <i>yourself</i>! Turn out one of
my thanes, if you can. If you can not, you must sit
on the footstool.”</p>

<p>“And so these savages spread themselves over the
world to prove their natural nobility. In Byzantium
they are the leaders of the Greek Emperor’s body
guard. From France they tear away her fairest provinces.
In England they are bosom friends of such
kings as Athelstane, and the sworn foes of Ethelred the
Unready. From Iceland as a base they push on to
Greenland, and colonize it; nay, they discover America
in those half-decked barks.”</p>

<p>“All this they do in the firm faith that the eyes of
the gods are upon them. Theirs was, in truth, a simple
creed; to do something and to do it well, so that it
might last as long as the world lasted. They were
superstitious, that is, they believed in a false religion;
but then they believed in it, which is more than all
the professors of the true religion can say. They were
proud; but humility is a plant of Christian soil. They
believed in luck; this, too, is a belief which a more
enlightened age has hardly shaken off. They were
revengeful; but revenge was the most sacred duty of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
society, which knew no voice more awful and impressive
than that of a brother’s blood calling from the
earth.”</p>

<p>“Nor let it be supposed that beneath these tall trees
of the forest, growth of emotions did not thrive, which
are the crown and joy of everyday life.”</p>

<p>“‘Weep not for me,’ says the dying warrior to his
wife, ‘lest those hot tears should scald my bosom and
spoil my rest.’”</p>

<p>“‘I was given young to my husband,’ says a faithful
wife, ‘and then I promised to live and die with him,’
and this she sings when the house is blazing over their
heads, and the foes that surround it offer to let her
escape.”</p>

<p>“The Icelanders were the bravest warriors, the boldest
sailors, and the most obstinate heathen; but they
were the best husbands, the tenderest fathers, and the
firmest friends of their day.”</p>

<p>Steadily the stream of the Northmen poured into
Iceland until in sixty years from the coming of Ingölfr
the population numbered over sixty thousand. So
much land was taken by the first-comers that an agreement
was made by which all those who came later could
take only as much land as they could encompass by fire
in a day. This was done by building a huge fire in the
center of the location, whence the claimant travelled in
a circle as far away from the fire as he could see the
smoke.</p>

<p>They brought with them the customs of Norway and
its worship of the northern gods. Neighbors gathered
in the <i>hústhing</i>, the freeholders in the <i>móthing</i> and the
nation in the <i>althing</i>. While great reverence was paid
to their gods, who were high ideals of what the people
aimed to become, yet their system reveals the presence
of an <i>unknown god</i>, indistinct, shadowy and undefined,
before whom even Odin, father of the gods, himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
must bow. After the diversified life of agriculture and
pillage was over, when the last feast had been given
and the last war-cry uttered, after Valhalla had received
the hero, there was still a lingering suspicion of something
yet beyond.</p>

<p>Christianity was forced upon the Norwegians by
Olaf Tryggvason and Olaf the Holy. During the rule
of the former, Thangbrand preached “Christ’s law”
in Iceland among the Eastfirthers, and in the <i>Burnt Njál</i>
in this connection we read:—</p>

<p>“Hall let himself be christened and all his household
and many other chieftains also; notwithstanding there
were many more who gainsaid him. Thangbrand abode
three winters in Iceland and was the bane of three men
or ever he departed thence.”</p>

<p>When Icelanders journeyed to Norway, Olaf gave
them their choice between taking christening or imprisonment.
Among the prisoners were Hjallti and
Gizur the White, the latter a prominent character in the
<i>Burnt Njál</i>. They agreed to go to Iceland and preach
the new faith if Olaf would release the prisoners. In
the year 1000 they went to the Althing at <i>Thingvellir</i>.
During a stormy debate a runner came from the <i>Ölfusá</i>
stating that a stream of lava was overflowing the homesteads.
The heathen men cried out,—</p>

<p>“No wonder that the gods are wroth at such speakers
as we have heard!”</p>

<p>Then Snorri the priest said,—</p>

<p>“At what then were the gods wroth when <i>this</i> lava
was molten and ran over the spot on which we now
stand?”</p>

<p>They could not answer him.</p>

<p>The following law was then passed,—</p>

<p>“This is the beginning of our laws; that all men
shall be Christian here in the land, and believe in one
God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, but leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
off all idol-worship, not expose children to perish, and
not eat horseflesh. It shall be outlawry if such things
are proved openly against any man; but if these things
are done by stealth, then it shall be blameless.”</p>

<p>The last clause of this law disappeared in a short
time and shows the growing hold of the new faith upon
the heathen. At first, it was a difficult task to induce
the Icelander to be baptized. The difficulty was removed
by the agreement that the warm springs should
be used as fonts. We may infer from this incident that
the rite as administered by King Olaf and his followers
was that of immersion. A few churches were built and
we read that Snorri the priest erected one at <i>Holyfell</i>.
Says the <i>Eyrbyggja Saga</i>,—</p>

<p>“This whetted men much to the building of churches,
that it was promised them by the teachers that a man
should have welcome place for as many men in the Kingdom
of Heaven as might stand in any church that he
let build.”</p>

<p>We do not see in this the softening influences of the
Christ-life, forgiveness and salvation; it is rather the
mediaeval conquest of the Church, which satisfied itself
with the symbol of the cross and the rite of holy
water. Christianity in this form was powerless to
subdue the stirring passions of alienated families, who
had long been trained to pay homage to such a god as
Odin and to whom the blood-feud was just as sacred as
the cross. Thus we see the spears and battle axes,
blazoned with the emblem of Christianity, returning
from foreign conquests to stain themselves anew in
homicidal strife. This very strife gave birth to Icelandic
letters.</p>

<p>During the long winter nights the nobles gave lengthened
banquets in their halls as their ancestors had aforetime
done in Scandinavia. During the progress of the
feast the scalds recounted the heroic deeds of their masters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
In the fitful glare of the firelight the joyous mead-bowl
circled and dissolved in song and cheer the sternness
of the north. Here were fought again the terrible
Heath Slayings. Here were recounted the deeds of
Howard the Halt, the quarrels of the Ere-Dwellers and
the stirring scenes of the Water Dale. The returning
Viking related his exploits in distant and fairer lands.
The legends and folk-lore, through repetition, were
clothed with choicer phrasing. These are vivid pictures
of the ancient days, simple, straightforward tales that
bear the stamp of truth and reveal the germ of a
splendid dramatic power.</p>

<p>With the introduction of Christianity came the use
of letters. The scalds and story tellers hastened to
avail themselves of this method to place in rhyme and
prose the idyls, the mythology and the history of the
race. Every strong and original race has vented its
emotions in literature. The Iliad and Odyssey express
the life of the plastic period of the Greek; the Aeneid
does the same for the Roman. Through the force of
the example set us by our schools, we turn to the study
of Greek and Latin, forgetful of our own rich expression
of the past or ignorant of its existence. Our early
tongue had its great epics. Presumption, it may be, to
compare them with the Iliad, but of great merit nevertheless.
Its chronicles were replete with the doings of
the people. This literature possesses a mythology that,
in its purity and noble sentiments, in its heroism and
spiritual aspirations, was never equalled.</p>

<p>Thus came into existence the Eddas and Sagas. Mr.
York Powell says that the earliest poets were a mixture
of Norwegian and Irish. And Howell adds,—</p>

<p>“Hence the Keltic grace that softened down the
Gothic strength.” The Eddas relate the earliest mythology,
the ancient Scandinavian religion. The first
Eddas were written by Saemundr the Wise in poetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
form and the later Eddas were put into beautiful prose
by Snorri Sturlason at <i>Reykholt</i>. The Landnamabók, the
doomsday book of Iceland, was written by several hands
but chiefly by Ari the Wise. The names and homes
of all the early settlers are given. Snorri Sturlason also
wrote the Heimskringla, “round world.” In it we read
not only the history of Iceland from the beginning but
of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland and England.
The list of Sagas is long and each has a special interest.
First of all is the <i>Njála</i>, so beautifully translated by
Dr. George Dasent, of which he says,—</p>

<p>“It bears away the palm for truthfulness and beauty.”</p>

<p>In the middle of the eleventh century the Icelandic
feuds had reached the point where all the great families
were weary of bloodshed and in the year 1262 they
surrendered their freedom to Hakon, King of Norway.
The people still held their own laws and met as customary
at the Althing. Says Howell,—</p>

<p>“But with the freedom passed the fruits of an heroic
age. The stream of spoil from foreign lands had
ceased to flow. The curb upon the chieftain checked
the scald; copying took the place of writing, and then
the land began to live upon the memories of the past.”</p>

<p>The century before the Reformation was one of sadness,
poverty and misery for Iceland. In 1360 Denmark
took possession of Norway and Iceland. In 1420
the Black Death visited the little nation and took for
toll two thirds of its population. In the fourteenth
century the Reformation which was sweeping Europe
reached Iceland, the gospel was given to the people and
in 1584 the first complete Bible was produced in Icelandic
by Bishop Guthbrandr Thorlaksson. With the
reformation, also came a revival of letters. In 1602
Denmark gave to a Copenhagen company a monopoly
of all Icelandic trade. This wrought an evil that was
not remedied until 1874, the effects of which are still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
experienced by the people. In the seventeenth century,
pirates from England, France and Barbary wrought
great havoc upon the unprotected coasts and carried
away hundreds of captives. Calamities came rapidly.
In 1707 the small pox claimed a toll of eighteen thousand
people. Fifty years later half a million sheep and
nearly all the cattle died of pestilence and as a result
famine stalked throughout the land. In 1783 a volcanic
eruption destroyed thirteen hundred people, many
cattle, twenty thousand horses and one hundred and
thirty thousand sheep. The heroic nation had reached
the limit of its endurance and Denmark relented. In
1800 the Althing which had met in the sunken plain of
<i>Thingvellir</i> for over nine hundred years left the Lögberg
to history and removed to <i>Reykjavik</i> to sit beneath
a roof. Then arose the Icelandic patriot, Jon Sigurðsson,
and through his labors Iceland received from the
hands of the King of Denmark, at the celebration of
its one thousandth anniversary, its constitution and its
practical freedom.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Why do you choose Iceland for a vacation?
I would go to a more interesting place, if
I were you.</p>

<p>This question has been asked so many
times and similar comments have followed so often before
I could answer the question that I write my answer
here, as an inducement to you, who can not take the
long journey with me literally, to follow me in imagination
through these pages and live with me for a few
brief hours in that far off land of fascination.</p>

<p>The people interest me. The country was settled,
not by serf nor servant. The grand old warriors of the
viking period, who overran in quick succession the
British Isles, ravaged the coast of France, swept through
the Mediterranean and even penetrated to Constantinople,
and wherever they went subdued and triumphed,—these
are the men who, once the lords and petty
kings of ancient Norway, scorning to bend the knee
to Harald, chose unknown dangers in a strange and
distant land, and going there sat down amidst the frosts
and volcanoes of Iceland to relate the story of their
deeds. From this virile race are the modern Icelanders
descended. They are a kindly, honest and hospitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
race; kind to each other and to the stranger within
their borders, hospitable with a hospitality which is
almost unknown in our selfish race, honest beyond all
question.</p>

<p>The literature fascinates me. The language, now
dead in its ancient Norse valleys, is a living speech in
Iceland. Its children read its ancient sagas, centuries
upon centuries old, as understandingly as their weekly
newspapers. It is just as if some long lost island of the
Aegian still held in all its ancient purity the musical
accent of the Homeric age, or, as if some forgotten
valley in the Italian Alps resounded with the rhetoric
of Cicero or vibrated to the tunes of Horace.</p>

<p>The scenery, the geology, has a charm unknown in
other lands. It is a country fresh from the crucible of
nature. Here one views a continent in the making, beholds
the mighty upheavals from the nether abyss, sees
how nature, as if ashamed of her rough work, planes
with her league-long blades of ice the basaltic ridges
and glassy peaks. The traveller beholds a country full
of lakes and rivers, and waterfalls the largest in
Europe, but a country without any system of mountain
chains and drainage to conform to the laws laid
down by the physiographer. Mountains there are in
abundance and lofty ones, but scattered hither and yon
at the strange caprice of Pluto. Rivers, both the delight
and the vexation of the traveller, inspiring in
the grandeur and unharnessed freedom of their mighty
canyons, vexing when they obstruct his passage, and he
must lift his hat in trust to swim their white currents
or else forbear the distant shore. In stern defiance of
obstacles the traveller journeys through a roadless country
where a thousand years since the progenitors of his
diminutive steed first bore their valiant masters. There
are miles of meadows smiling in the lengthened summer
day and freely sprinkled with a rich and beautiful flora;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
there are quaking bogs to cross and quicksands, where
the judgment of his pony surpasses his rider’s wisdom;
there are wastes of wind driven sand without a scrap of
vegetation to enliven the scene; there are mountain
ranges to be crossed, perhaps where no one ever pressed
the lava; there are beautiful valleys, rich with flocks and
herds and alive with horses; there are areas of smoking
lands, ill-smelling and sizzling fumaroles, boiling springs
and blue-black mud cauldrons which vomit their horrid
contents with a sickening gasp; lakes and ponds innumerable,
where live unmolested a myriad waterfowl,
where flowers bloom in a profusion often rare in more
southern climes.</p>

<p>The homes are simple, humble and pastoral. An
ancient house of turf and stone, an enclosed mowing
patch, the sheep folds and the byre, a scanty garden
where a few hardy vegetables rejoice in the long, long
day. Even the endless day has its charm, the nearly
continuous sunshine and the fleecy clouds in the bluest
of blue skies, the lights and shadows on lake and mountain,
the extreme clearness of the atmosphere, clear to
the point of great deception to the inexperienced,—the
colors, I did not forget them, nor will one having
seen the richest of nature’s colors in these grand old
volcanic piles with streaks of emerald and patches of
brown, gray, yellow, red and crimson all washed and
blended with the fan-like brush of melting snow, ever
forget.</p>

<p>Why do I go to Iceland? Because the people appeal,
the old stories of heroic deeds stir the sluggish blood of
city life, and the thought of being foot-loose and care-free
throughout its lingering summer day to roam at
will its mountain vales and smiling meadows impels me.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Iceland is an island in the north Atlantic just
east of Greenland. There is no boat service between
it and America. The American must embark
either from Copenhagen or from Leith. The
Copenhagen boats, the mail boats of <i>Det Forenede
Dampskibs-Selskab</i>, always call at Leith and it is by this
line and from Leith that we have always sailed for
Iceland.</p>

<p>We went on board the <i>Laura</i> at the Albert Dock
in the afternoon of the eighth of July 1909, and
steamed out through the Firth of Forth. At last, after
3000 miles of ocean travel we were <i>en route</i> for Iceland.
The little boat was crowded to overflowing and two
English ladies slept in the starboard boat as it hung
from the davits. Among the passengers there were
eleven different nationalities. The <i>Laura</i> looked diminutive
compared with the transatlantic liner from
which we had disembarked but three days previously.
We viewed her not without some doubt as to her behavior
in the stormy waters of the north. She was
an ancient boat, one could tell that at a glance as well
as by another sense, but she was staunch. When the
skipper told me that the display of bunting from peak
to peak was in commemoration of her two hundredth
consecutive trip to Iceland, I said to my wife,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“The boat is all right, it all rests with the skipper.”
This proved to be prophetic. Captain Aasberg took us
safely through the stormiest passage we have experienced
in these waters and landed us all safely as he had
done with so many passengers previously. On the return
he resigned and the owners turned the <i>Laura</i> over to a
new skipper. Whether she was disobedient to her new
master or not, I can not say, but on his first trip she
climbed the lava ridges north of Iceland and her ribs
are still grinding in the sluiceways. Better a frail boat
and a staunch captain than the converse.</p>

<p>The passage northward is full of interest with such
special features to attract the attention as,—the shipping
activity of Aberdeen and Peterhead, the North
Sea trawlers and the herring fleet, the smaller fishing
craft venturing shorter distances from the protection
of the great headlands, the grand old promontories of
the Pentland Firth and the Skerries, to discuss all of
which would shorten our journey in Iceland.</p>

<p>We can not pass the Orkneys without a word of
notice. They were the Isles-West-Over-the-Sea of the
Vikings. Here they fled at first from the wrath of
Harald, here they fitted out their expeditions for all
lands, here they recuperated and quarrelled with themselves
and the mixed race of the mainland of Scotland.
Here was written that great Saga of the northland, the
<i>Orkneyinga Saga</i>, a stirring tale of Harald, the Earls
of Orkney and of Scotland. Passing Kirkwall, the
square Norman tower of its ancient cathedral attracts
the eye. Pleasing is the crescent city on the quiet bay.
How peaceful and how changed from the days of the
Vikings! We recall that this is the center of the action
in Scott’s Pirate, that fine story of much earlier days.
On yonder crag Norna of the Fitful Head uttered
her wild incantations, in this same kirk she plotted with
the mysterious pirate while those fair fields with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
upland flocks are the same as in the days of Halco and
Magnus.</p>

<p>The Old Man of Hoy blends with the cliffs as we
pass, the famous Naup Head sinks into the sea and the
<i>Laura</i> in a smother of fog and drizzle turns confidently
towards Faroe. Forty-six hours out from Leith
the <i>Laura</i> found her old anchorage in <i>Thorshaven</i>,
the capital of the Faroe Isles. We found it a great
relief to go ashore for a few hours to visit the shops
of these people. The place and the people are worthy
of a special chapter which will follow this one. The
passage through the fiords was fortunately made in
clear weather and the scenery is impressive.</p>

<p>Lonely and grand in the north Atlantic rise the storm-scarred
cliffs of Faroe. They are the stepping stones
to Iceland and as such were used as a resting place by
the first mariners of these waters.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Considering the latitude and its isolation
in the north Atlantic, the climate of Faroe
is comparatively mild. Fierce storms from
the north beat down upon the islands and
the heavy sea often surges for days together through
these narrow channels making it impossible for boats
to pass from shore to shore. Even in calm weather
the tide currents often run at ten knots an hour so
that it is necessary for the boatman to have an accurate
knowledge of the currents in order to make progress.
The high peaks are covered with snow frequently
throughout the summer, but snow seldom lingers in the
valleys over a fortnight even in the winter.</p>

<p>The temperature is low in summer and correspondingly
high in winter. Heavy fogs cover the islands during
the greater portion of the year and a perfectly clear
day is rare. When the sun breaks through the mists,
the effect of the shifting clouds, the areas of snow on
the upper peaks and the myriads of waterfalls form a
magnificent picture.</p>

<p>Seventeen of the islands are inhabited with a population
of 16,000 people. The largest island is <i>Strömö</i>,
Stream, which is twenty-seven miles long. The capital,
<i>Thorshaven</i>, Harbor-of-Thor, with a population of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
8,000 people, is located on the east coast of <i>Strömö</i>.
These islands belong to Denmark and have two representatives
in the Danish Parliament. All local affairs
are conducted in the <i>Lagthing</i>, Law-Assembly,
at <i>Thorshaven</i>. The people are exempt from conscription
and of nearly all customs, duties and taxes. The
members of the <i>Lagthing</i> are chosen by ballot for a
term of three years. The President is appointed by the
Danish King for life. The local taxes are collected by
native sheriffs, who canvass their districts four times
each year. The sheriffs also have charge of the division
and distribution of the captured whales. Lawyers
are resident at <i>Thorshaven</i> and at no other place in
the islands. Criminal and civil cases are tried before
a judge and without a jury. All petty cases come before
the local sheriff. The head man of each village
enforces the sanitary regulations and other local rules.
There are no policemen in the islands and crime, unless
committed by foreign sailors, usually Scotch fishermen,
is extremely rare. The <i>Faroese</i> are peaceable and sensitive
of any scandal if it passes beyond the borders of
their own village. It is the duty of every man to see to
it that the law is maintained, and they keep a careful
watch of all foreigners when on shore.</p>

<p>There is only one jail in the islands and a Faroeman
smilingly declared to me that it was for the sole benefit
of the Shetland fishermen. The law permits a prisoner
to diet only on bread and water. A man serving a sentence
spends three days in jail and then enjoys three
days of freedom alternately until the entire term of the
confinement is completed. There is no danger of his
making an escape.</p>

</div>

<p>In <i>Thorshaven</i> and in the larger villages there are
schools. There is also a Teacher’s College in the capital
city. The people have local option in educational
matters and many prefer to teach their children at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
home. If it is voted to have a school in a given village,
then all the children must attend it, the parents must
supply a teacher and provide sufficient pasturage for
one cow for the use of the teacher, but the government
pays the meager salary.</p>

<p>The results of their home education are excellent;
the children study for the sake of knowledge. The
most simple ones have a good knowledge of history
and geography. The law requires that the church services,
the village schools and the proceedings of the
<i>Lagthing</i> be conducted in Danish. On all other occasions
the Faroeman uses his own language. They
use the Danish only upon compulsion. There is a
strong anti-Danish feeling which is kept alive by the
supercilious behavior and affected superiority of the
resident Danes, who, however, in politeness, integrity
and hospitality are inferior to the Faroese. The Danes
in Faroe are not to be confounded by the reader with
the Danes resident in Denmark.</p>

<p>The people are stoutly built, with fair complexions,
usually handsome, mostly short in stature, broad shouldered
and rugged, descendants of the ancient Norse Vikings
who settled in Faroe prior to the settlement of Iceland.
They have kept the race pure. If asked his nationality,
the Faroeman proudly replies,—“I am a Faroeman.”</p>

<p>The men have a national costume, which is shown in
the frontispiece of this volume. This suit I purchased
of Peter Arge in <i>Thorshaven</i>. I asked him where I
could obtain one of these suits and he took me to the
little bed room at the top of his house and asked me to
try on his best suit. I did it and found that it fitted
closely, and so it was in style in <i>Thorshaven</i>. He
willingly sold it saying that he could make another during
the winter when there was no work. A brief description
of this costume is not out of place at this point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
It consists of knickerbockers, slashed at the knee and
secured with four silver buttons and a broad, double-hinged
silver buckle. The waistcoat is scarlet, fastened
with six silver buttons. A continuous spray of forget-me-nots,
daintily worked with colored silk, extends
down each edge of the waistcoat and across the two
diminutive pockets. A tightly fitting jersey of homespun,
with twenty-four silver buttons, twelve on a side,
is put over the waistcoat and over this, in cold weather,
is worn a short heavy jacket fastened with silver buttons
of large size. This is used much as we use an overcoat.
The cap is of closely woven material in fine stripes of red
and blue; it has no visor, is cylindrical in shape and
gathered at the top in the form of a rosette, which is
pulled down on the right hand side and fastened at the
edge of the cap. Thick, homespun stockings of soft
wool and sheepskin slippers,—or sometimes a Danish
shoe with silver buckles,—fastened around the ankles
with red or white cord complete the costume. No,—the
Faroeman is not fully “dressed” without his beautifully
inlaid knife in a highly ornamented sheath fastened
to his belt with a twisted cord. This knife, as
well as scores of similar knives from Faroe, was made
by Mr. Arge, who is expert at inlaying shell, silver and
wood. The suit was made in his own family and his
daughter embroidered the waistcoat. The Faroese
women, like the Icelandic men, have no national costume.</p>

<p>The people are very seclusive. Many families claim
descent from the ancient Kings of Norway and Scotland,
and will marry only among themselves. They
are so clannish that the people on one island rarely
marry with those of another island. To illustrate,—A
woman born on Strömö married a man from <i>Nalsö</i>.
The result was that she was boycotted by all the <i>Nalsö</i>
people. Contrary to the dogma of the medical fraternity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
this inbreeding has not produced extremely abnormal
offspring. Mental, moral and physical degeneration
has not resulted from this long series of close
inbreeding.</p>

<p>The language of the Faroese must be classed as a
dialect. Although having the same origin as the Icelandic
tongue, it differs strongly in pronunciation. In
the Viking days the same speech was employed in Norway,
Faroe and in Iceland. Icelandic has remained
nearly pure but Faroe, being in close contact with Shetland,
Orkney and with the numerous fishermen, its
language has been much adulterated. Faroe has its Sagas
as well as Iceland, Norway and Orkney, but there
were no Sagamen or historians as in Iceland. The modern
Faroese dialect has been written less than eighty
years. The ballads, folklore and traditions are now being
reduced to writing by the scholars and many French,
English, Danish and Icelandic works have been translated.</p>

<p>The Faroese have escaped the demoralizing influences
of the continent and for centuries have lived
simply and quietly along the lines of their ancient customs.
Their hospitality is generous, their courtesy to
strangers extensive, their inborn honesty is perfect.
The people, when not engaged in fish curing or in whale
dissection, are clean and their homes are models of
tidiness. Their centuries of isolation and peaceful living
have eradicated every trace of the cruelty, piracy
and murderous tendencies of their Viking progenitors.
They have some vices,—what nation has none? They
lack originality, their ambition and energy is at a low
ebb, they take life as a matter of fact and do not
worry. They surpass all other people in their love of
gossip and in sarcasm. There is a lack of gaiety and
a tendency towards melancholy. If climate has any effect
upon the spirits of a race, surely the heavy fogs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
that hang over these islands for weeks and saturate
everything with chilling moisture, are responsible for
the melancholy. The long, dark winters, the continuous
roar of ocean through these ancient fiords is also
responsible for the mental cast of the race. But, they
have a peculiar humor and are fond of joking each
other. This is a trait inherited from their Viking ancestors
and this trait is strong in Iceland. The people
dislike very much to be laughed at or to pose as objects
of curiosity before the gaze of the foreigner. It was
with the greatest difficulty that I obtained my series of
one hundred photographs of these people and their
homes.</p>

<p>Conservatism is their prevailing characteristic. Some
European method or idea may be better than their own,
but they cling to their ancient customs as their bird
catchers to the cliffs. They build their houses as did
their grandfathers <i>because</i> their grandfathers constructed
their dwellings after the designs of more remote
generations. Birch bark is still imported from
Norway to cover the drift-wood rafters and over this is
placed a layer of turf where the grass grows throughout
the year and the flowers bloom in profusion in the
long summer. The ancient wooden weighing beam,
the quaint antique iron lamp for train oil, the implements
of the forge, the fishing tackle, the boats and
their rigging,—all are constructed according to ancestral
specifications. Modern ideas are scoffed at, the
old ways are the best. The Faroese are happy in their
own seclusion and they live in the shadowy paths between
the superstitions of ancient Scandinavia and the
vigorous, pulsing life of western civilization. They
care little for the outside world and its problems. A
local newspaper, in spite of the submarine cable, gives
only a fourth of a column to news of the outside world;
the remainder is filled with gossip which every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
knew before the sheet issued from the press.</p>

<p>The streets of <i>Thorshaven</i> are narrow, uneven,
crooked and crowded. The houses are built mostly of
wood on high stone foundations, the walls are frequently
coated with tar and in the summer time festoons of
fish are suspended from the gables to dry. Within the
home everything is neat and clean, the Norway spruce
is sanded, colored by time and untarnished with paint
and has become a beautiful chestnut brown.</p>

<p>The people retain some of their ancient superstitions
and believe that the result of a day’s fishing, or success
in bird-netting, will depend upon some chance of minor
importance. The <i>trolls</i>, underground people of diminutive
stature, elves and fairies live largely in the
imagination and the folk stories relative to these phantoms
have a strong influence upon the children. Where
the cliffs rise directly out of the sea, there are many
isolated columns, like the “Old Man of Hoy” in
Orkney, which have been left standing by erosion of
the waves. The water surges around them and they
stand erect in the mists, solitary and unpressed by human
foot. The Faroese call them the “Fingers of the
Norns” and the fishermen hold them in deep superstition.
This northern superstition, the control of mortals
by unseen powers, has been made use of by Sir Walter
Scott in that mysterious character in the <i>Pirate</i>, Norna
of the Fitful Head.</p>

<p>The people are chiefly occupied in fishing, sheep raising
and bird catching. The codfish abound in these
cool northern waters, especially on the Faroe Bank.
They not only secure enough of them for their own
consumption but export large quantities to the Catholic
countries of the Mediterranean. As in Labrador and
in Iceland, so in Faroe, the fishing is done by the men,
while the splitting, cleaning, curing and packing is the
work of the women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The one time in the year when the Faroese are
moved from the even tenor of their way is during the
whale drive. This is a yearly affair that takes place
during the latter part of July or early in August. It is
the one great sport of the country and upon its success
depends the condition of the larder during the long
winter. This is the bottle-nose whale, <i>Hyperoodon
rostratum</i>, a small species from fifteen to twenty-two
feet in length. They frequent the north Atlantic in
large schools. The Faroese are constantly on the look
out for them and when the whales enter the channels
the summons by signals and telephone is rapidly passed
from island to island. In an incredibly short time the
school is nearly surrounded by the boats of the excited
fishermen with harpoons and spears. Because of the
great shouting and the closing together of the boats,
the whales become frightened and frantically rush to
the shore where most of them are stranded, few ever
escape. From the boats, from the shore, and in the
water, the slender harpoon is hurled with deadly aim.
The whale once struck is securely anchored and the harpooner
hastens to secure another victim. When the
slaughter is over, the heads are cut off and numbered,
the bodies cut up and distributed under the direction of
the sheriffs and an equitable distribution of the flesh
and fat is made according to law. Not only do the
people actually present at the whale slaughter receive
their portion but all the people in the district receive
their just share. The flesh of these whales is similar
to dark colored coarse grained beef, but when nicely
broiled is a palatable and nutritious dish. The body
is enveloped with two to six inches of fat, which has
the consistency of hard fat pork. This is salted and
used by the people as we use salt pork. The flesh is
smoked, dried or salted. Owing to the scarcity of grass
the Faroese cows sometimes subsist upon dried whale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
meat in the winter and often eat dried fish heads.</p>

<p>The third occupation of the people is bird catching.
This is followed by a restricted portion of the population.
The great cliffs of Faroe, ranking with the finest
in the world, are the homes of myriads of sea birds.
Bird catching is an art as well as an occupation and
has descended from father to son through many generations.
The skua, puffin, guillemot and eider duck are
among the more numerous birds. They are taken for
their flesh, oil and feathers. Many of the birds are
captured in nets similar to a butterfly net, except that
the net is flat and spread between two forks at the end
of a long pole. I measured one of these nets and found
the handle to be eighteen feet long and each of the
Y-shaped prongs was six feet. Between the arms of
the Y is stretched the net. In use the fowler sits upon
a rock and when he sees a puffin flying directly towards
him he elevates the net, the bird is clumsy, unable to
quickly change his direction and flying into the net
becomes entangled. I sat by one of the fowlers in Iceland
one day who was working with one of these nets
and in thirty minutes he secured forty birds. Often
times the record of two or more a minute is made, when
the birds are flying well. The puffin burrows in the
ground like a rabbit and there rears its young. During
the day they haunt the sea, collect small fish and then
fly in great companies in long files to their nests.</p>

<p>The fowler is also an expert cragsman and whether
he creeps along the narrow shelf hundreds of feet above
the sea and works his way from point to point on the
overhanging cliffs, or is suspended like a pendulum on
a rope four to five hundred feet, he is cool, collected,
skillful, and always successful. In fact he is the best
cragsman in the world.</p>

<p>There are a few domestic arts that have reached
perfection, as far as their purpose is concerned, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
as spinning, weaving, fulling, embroidering, boat-building
and metal decorating. The Faroeman is an expert
at wood and bone carving and at metal inlaying.
My Faroese sheath knife, made by Peter Arge, is a
model of skillful construction, deftly inlaid with the
mother of pearl and silver. The sheath is of ebony,
inlaid with silver in the form of a whale boat, harpoon
and fish hooks.</p>

<p>Faroe is the stepping stone to Iceland. I have
visited it on seven different occasions, have passed
through nearly every one of its numerous channels,
wandered through the villages, attended a country auction
much like that held in the rural districts of New
England, climbed the lower slopes of its hills which
overlook the fiords, witnessed the marvelous bird life
and learned a little about the quaint inhabitants and
my experience has been such that I can cordially recommend
these lofty islands as a delightful spot for a summer’s
holiday. The tourist will be given all necessary
assistance and information, whether he desires to paint,
fish in the little lakes of the glacial valleys, accompany
the fowler in his dangerous occupation upon the cliffs
or journey from island to island through the wonderful
channels with the fishermen. He will obtain homely
but clean and nutritious food, and when the crust of
conservatism is broken and the confidence of the host
is secured, he will pass many an hour in delightful conversation
which will store his mind with quaint anecdotes
and ancient myths. He will leave the islands
with regret and in after years will sometimes long for
the serene and peaceful life of the Faroese, where
worry, care and social duties do not intrude and he will
count among his warmest friends the stoical Faroese.</p>

<p>With the ever changing mood of sea and sky these
isles present a kaleidoscopic picture. The frowning cliffs
alive with sea birds, where “clouds on clouds arise,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the higher pinnacles obscured or banded with drifting
cloud ribbons, the patches of pristine snow high up
in the mountain clefts from which numerous waterfalls
leap the cliffs to fall in silver spray upon the sea,
the quaintly garbed Faroese swinging like pendulums
from the projecting lava to net the birds, or, bobbing
in their boats upon the waves, the tiny homes set in a
bit of emerald vegetation in an angle of the mountain
wall, the changing panorama of sea, cliff and sky as the
boat raced with the current through the tortuous channels
and turned the last rockspire into the northern
ocean and the fading of the mighty headlands in the
purple haze of a midnight twilight,—these were the
elements of a picture well worth ten thousand miles of
travel. Faroe with the quaintness of twelve centuries
of isolation dropped below the horizon and the next
land to delight the eye was to be Iceland.</p>

<p>I was with the mate on the bridge at five the next
morning and as anxious as was <i>Ingölfr</i> and his foster
brother, <i>Hjörleifr</i>, eleven centuries before, to discover
what secrets these northern waters held,—when the
dim outline of land was seen through the shifting fog.
An enthusiastic Dane, an Icelandic maiden and her
Swedish lover started the national anthem of Iceland.</p>

<p>The morning vapors are scattered. The ocean is
a thing of life. It rolls in all the wild freedom of the
north, rich in livid shades of blue and green in the
nearer circle of our vision while on the far horizon it
is a sparkling amethyst beneath the deeper azure of the
bending sky. To the north, the circle is broken by the
abrupt basaltic towers of <i>Ingölfshofði</i>. Beyond these
rise the red and brown fragments of extinct craters, and
yet beyond and towering far above them are the
glaciated <i>Jökulls</i> down whose sides rush mighty torrents
to dash in uncounted waterfalls into the impatient
sea. It was at this point that the foster brothers cast
overboard the temple pillars of <i>Ingölfr</i>, who vowed by
<i>Odin</i>, that upon whatever coast they were cast, there
would he found his colony. <i>Hjörleifr</i> went to the
neighboring islands, the Westmans, where he was soon
afterwards murdered by his Irish serfs. <i>Ingölfr</i> tarried
here for about three years and sent parties along the
coast to search for the lost pillars.</p>

<p>This bold promontory is also noted in the Saga of

of Njal was wrecked when returning from his
exile. Near here stood the house of Flosi, the lifelong
enemy of Kari. The incident shows the sacredness of
hospitality among these savage people. Kari went
boldly to Flosi and asked for succor from the storm.
The Burner, in spite of the sworn enmity to Kari,
granted his request, welcomed him with a Scandinavian
welcome and afterwards they became lifelong friends.</p>

<p class="dropcap">These islands are named for the Irish slaves,
formerly called Westmen, who are reported
to have fled to this desolate pile in 879. For
centuries it was the resort of piratical expeditions
from England and from far-away Barbary. The
first recorded attack was made by an English crew
under the command of “Gentleman John.” Three
years afterwards the church property was restored by
King James, and John was severely punished.</p>

<p>The greatest raid was made in 1627. Barbary
pirates were planning an expedition for plunder. One
of them held a Danish slave by the name of Paul, who
was tired of his life of servitude and counseled his master
to make an expedition to Iceland. He stated that
he had been there and could pilot them and that
they could obtain a large profit in sheep and church
valuables as well as many slaves. The expedition was
decided upon and for his treachery he was to receive
his freedom. The flotilla comprised four ships, one
sailing from <i>Kyle</i> and three from Algiers. June 15
1627 the ship from <i>Kyle</i> reached <i>Grimdavik</i>, Iceland.
They ransacked the village and took several prisoners.
The people mistook the pirates for English fishermen,
who had long been in the habit of landing on the coast
to steal a few sheep, and so did not flee. The Moors
captured a Danish trading vessel and then sailed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
<i>Hafnarfjörðr</i>. After raiding this settlement they
sailed for <i>Kyle</i>, which they reached in five weeks from
their departure. Their prisoners were sold in the slave
market.</p>

<p>The three ships from Algiers reached <i>Berufjörðr</i>
and thoroughly sacked the town. They remained on
the Iceland coast eight days, captured one hundred and
ten people and secured a large amount of booty from
the treasure chests of the people and the churches.
They were extremely cruel with the older people but
quite kind to the children, hoping to convert them to
the faith of Mohammed. To illustrate,—</p>

<p>At <i>Hál</i> they found the priest’s wife, an aged woman,
confined to the bed with sickness. They dragged her
down to the shore, but finding her physically unable
to go with them, beat her into an unconscious state with
their muskets, a condition much to be preferred to
that in which so many of her people found themselves
in Moorish slavery.</p>

<p>They next set sail for the Westman Isles. They
pressed into service an Icelandic renegade who had
acted as pilot for English fishing boats. At this time
the population of <i>Heimaey</i> was of two classes; first, Icelandic
fishermen and birdcatchers and second, a small
Colony of Danish officials and their servants. The Icelanders
so mistrusted the Danes that they fled to the
cliffs rather than assist them to repel the invaders. The
Danish agent, Bagge, armed his assistants and prepared
as best he could for defense, posting sentinels around
the island.</p>

<p>Early in the morning Thorstein showed the pirates
a secret path up the face of the cliffs at the south, which
they ascended and spread out their damp powder to
dry. During this time they danced and yelled in fiendish
glee looking down upon their helpless victims. The
raiders then divided into three bands and thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
ransacked the village. They looted the church and in
mockery rang the bells, arrayed themselves in the vestments
of the priest and finally burned the church. The
people fled to the several caves in the tufa, many were
murdered while in flight and others captured and bound.
For three days one hundred people hid in one of these
caves which is so concealed that it is with difficulty that
it can be found.</p>

<p>Jon Thorstein, the first translator of the Psalms into
Icelandic verse, a priest, since called “the Martyr,”
took refuge in a small cave with his family where he
doubtless would have been saved had it not been for
the curiosity of a companion who ventured to the entrance
and exposed himself and thus attracted the attention
of the pirates. The following account is from
the history of Björn of <i>Scandsá</i>:—</p>

<p>“The priest went to the outer part of the cave, where
he saw that blood ran in the opening; and then he
hied him out, and saw that Snorri lay headless at the
door of the cave: for the raiders had shot off his head,
and he had been to them a signal for the cave. Then
Jon went within again telling this hap; and he bade
his folks beseech Almighty God to succor them. Forthwith
thereafter these noisy hounds stood over the cave,
so that he heard their footfall.</p>

<p>“‘Margrjet, they are coming,’ he said, ‘Lo, I will go
to meet them without fear!’</p>

<p>“He prayed that God’s grace might not leave her.
But while the words were in the saying, the bloodthirsty
hounds came to the cave’s mouth and would
search it, but the priest went out to meet them. Now
when they saw him, one of them said,” (doubtless the
renegade, Thorstein),—</p>

<p>“‘Why art thou here, Sira Jon? Ought’st not to be at
home in thy church?’ The priest answered—</p>

<p>“‘I was there this morning.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Then said the murderer,</p>

<p>“‘Thou wilt not be there to-morrow morning.’
And thereafter he cut him on the head to the bone.
The priest stretched out his hands and said,—</p>

<p>“‘I commit me to my God. That thou doest do
freely!’ The wretch then struck him another blow.
At this he cried out saying,—</p>

<p>“‘I commit me to my Lord Jesus Christ.’</p>

<p>“Then Margrjet, the priest’s wife, cast herself at the
feet of the tyrant, and clung to them, thinking that his
heart might be softened, but there was no pity in these
monsters. Then the scoundrel struck a third blow.
The priest said,—</p>

<p>“‘That is enough. Lord Jesus receive my soul!’
Then the foul man cleft his skull asunder. Thus he
lost his life.</p>

<p>“There was a little rift higher up in the cliff than
where these folk lay, and two women saw and heard
all these things.”</p>

<p>Nearly four hundred Icelanders were carried to the
Algerian slave markets where most of them speedily
succumbed to the cruelty of their masters and the hot
climate. Of the many carried away only thirteen ever
returned to their native land.</p>

<p>When <i>Herjölfr</i> settled in the Westman islands,
legend relates that he buried a large amount of gold,
part of which he obtained in his Viking expeditions
to the English Channel and the remainder by selling
the water of the only spring on <i>Heimaey</i>. His daughter,
Vilborg, in true charity and by stealth, distributed
the water to poor people in times of drought. The
residents of the island delight to show the niche in the
tufa where <i>Herjölfr</i> stabled his horses. The only spring
on <i>Heimaey</i> to this day is called Vilpá in memory of
the maiden. Her father with all his wealth was buried
during an earthquake and the inhabitants, when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
have nothing else to do, delight in searching for the
hidden treasure which the leader of the pirates, Morad,
failed to find.</p>

<p>The Westman Isles are fourteen in number and lie
seven miles off the south coast of Iceland. Four of
these are entirely barren, sea-washed and storm-beaten,
affording admirable nesting places for sea birds. The
strait which separates them from the mainland is shallow,
beset with shoals and hidden reefs and contains
several treacherous currents. The mainland shore, the
<i>Rangar Sands</i>, has a broad morass of drifting volcanic
sand, upon which heavy waves continually break, rendering
it nearly impossible to launch or beach a boat.
Thus the Westman Isles are isolated much more than
the narrow strait would indicate.</p>

<p>Until within a few years the children born on
<i>Heimaey</i> have always died within two weeks of birth
with infantile tetanus. It was formerly the custom
for prospective mothers to visit the mainland to save
their children from this dread disease. Improved sanitary
conditions and scientific medical treatment have
lately made this customary precaution unnecessary. Formerly
the inhabitants were recruited by residents of the
north of Iceland.</p>

<p><i>Heimaey</i>, the “Home Island,” has an area of only
four square miles and a population of less than one
thousand. The village is on the northern side of the
island, on the south shore of a little bay, under the
bird cliffs which afford a harbor for small craft and
then only in calm weather. This little bay is separated
from the strait by the grand bird cliffs 2000 feet
high, which are attached to the island by a narrow rim
of volcanic sand. A solitary cone, <i>Helgafell</i>, with a
black crater stands at the center of the island and
<i>Heimaey</i> clings to the lower slope of the volcano, apparently
ready to loose its grip and slip into the sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
The land slopes gently upward to the cone of cinder,
tufa, and ash. The lower slopes are covered with a
scanty carpet of grass freely sprinkled with flowers,
where uncertain pasturage invites the sheep and forms
a strong contrast to the red and black cone which rises
naked against sea and sky.</p>

<p>The remainder of the island is a rough and jagged
mass of lava, partly disintegrated into a desolate moor
and partly storm-swept to the very ribs of the island.
No brook chatters in the dark ravines, no trees shadow
the sheep from summer’s long sunshine. Wherever the
lava has crumbled to mingle with the droppings of uncounted
generations of seabirds, the grass is emerald
green as if in memory of the first settlers from the Emerald
Isle. The climate is mild and enjoys the highest
mean temperature in all Iceland. For centuries the
people have had to depend upon their own resources.
In recent years they have obtained supplies from
Europe in exchange for oil, fish and feathers.</p>

<p>The houses, for the most part, are tidy little homes
often with a little patch of carefully guarded cultivation.
At the rear of the village stands the modest
parish church, containing a good altar piece painted
upon wood. Beside the church is the cemetery enclosed
with a wall of lava and turf. The graves are
mounds raised high above the level of the land, because
the lava is so near the surface that to dig a
grave is impossible and dirt is carried to the cemetery
to form the mounds.</p>

<p>Excavations made in the volcanic sand in 1910 by
Baron Klinckowström of Stockholm help to fix the date
of the last eruption of the volcano. In the sand and
ash he found evidences of a former people, a comb
of ancient Scandinavian construction and the bones of
the seal and sheep. One great volcano formerly covered
this entire area and poured out ashes and cinder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
all around it. This material has since solidified into
tufa and much of the tufa has been worn away, leaving
many solid columns of the original lava core, which
stand isolated in the sea. Then came the second eruption
when the crater of <i>Helgafell</i> was formed. The
references given in the Landámabók and the exhumed
material fix the date of this eruption subsequent to the
settlement of the island by the Irish slaves. The tufa
itself is very hard for this class of volcanic rock. It is
weathered in fantastic forms with myriads of niches
and contains several sea caves. One of these is so large
that we entered it in a thirty foot naptha launch and
turned about within. The view from within is strange
and impressive. The deep azure of the waters, the
light brown tufa dome, the dark cone of <i>Helgafell</i>
rising above the village and the clouds of sea birds
shadowing the entrance to the cave and filling the air
with a resounding clangor on our exit made a mark
on memory’s tablet never to be effaced.</p>

<p>The most interesting occupation in <i>Heimaey</i> is bird
catching. Of course the fish curing is worthy of attention,
but then it is much the same whether we see
it on the drear coast of Labrador, the green slopes of
the Faroes, the lava blocks of Iceland or the wood
stages of Gloucester. With the inhabitants of this volcanic
pile it is not only a business it is a pleasure and
an art which has culminated with generations of experience.
The fulmar, puffin and guillemot are the
principal birds taken. Throughout the summer the raucid
clamor of the fulmars on the face of the cliffs mingles
with the complaints of the puffins which stand in long
rows like lines of soldiers, and the guillemots scan each
other sagely from their captured niches in the tufa.
These mammoth cliffs are riddled with holes and cracks
and ornamented with narrow, projecting ledges. Above
the cliffs there is an abundance of loose material where
the shearwaters and puffins excavate their burrows.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The cliffs are the property of the Danish Crown and
are rented annually in sections at a price ranging from
sixty to seventy-five dollars. The laws governing bird
catching are well defined and strict. The season and
method of capture of each species is explicitly stated.
A gun can never be used under any circumstances.
No act can be committed which would in the least disturb
the birds. The eider duck can never be killed except
by a man who can prove that he was actually starving
with no other means of procuring food. But above
all the laws and rendering laws unnecessary is a sound
public opinion.</p>

<p>All the birds are very tame. Tens of thousands of
puffins sit upright along the tops of the crags, many
of them still holding rows of little fishes in their great
beaks. The catchers station themselves at definite intervals
along the cliffs and catch them in a net as they
fly past. Their necks are broken with a sudden twist
as the net is unloaded and the birds left in piles along
the ground or thrown to the bottom of the cliff to be
gathered by the boys and women who pluck them.
The breast is used for food. The remainder of the
birds are strung on long lines and hung upon the fences
or festooned from the gables of the houses to dry and
to furnish fuel. A single puffin is worth when first captured
about a cent and a half. The down is sold at the
trader’s store for thirteen cents per pound. About
40,000 puffins are taken on these cliffs each season.</p>

<p>The fulmar is nearly as important as the puffin.
About 30,000 are captured during the open season.
The fulmar, “foul-gull,” is appropriately named.
When captured or disturbed it spits a large quantity of
oily fluid, rank with the odor of putrid fish. These
birds are taken by the simple act of knocking them over
with a club. Several men usually work in unison. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
man has a long rope fastened to his waist and then
twisted around each thigh. Suspended in the air, or
with his feet against the face of the cliff he ascends or
descends the sides of the rock, kicking himself outward.
The rope is managed by three or four men at
the top of the cliff and sometimes secured by an iron
ring fastened in the rock.</p>

<p>The fulmars are plucked, the heads and wings cut
off, the body split open, the interior fat cleaned out, and
then the birds are either smoked or packed in salt for
winter use. The fat is boiled down to a thick oil, spiced
and used as a substitute for butter. Ten fulmars will
yield a liter of oil. The oil is used in the native lamps.
The entrails, heads, wings and legs are dried and used
for fuel. It is so difficult to free the feathers from the
oil that they are of little value. When thoroughly
cleaned they are worth only twelve cents per pound.
The birds themselves when cured are worth four cents
each.</p>

<p>Nearly a thousand gannets, Solon Goose, are taken
in these islands each year. Why it is called the “Solon”
is not known. It is possible that it really possesses
wisdom in excess of other geese. Scientifically it is
not a real goose. A great many kittiwakes and guillemots
are captured though the total value is much less
than the above mentioned birds.</p>

<p>The young men of <i>Heimaey</i> capture the stormy
petrels alive for the purpose of playing jokes with
them. The birds give a sound similar to the purring
of a cat. Several of them are let loose in the night
in the house of the person on whom the joke is to be
played. The birds dart about the house in a lively
manner and give their cry of alarm which is weird
and uncanny. It produces the desired effect upon the
sleeper as he awakens.</p>

<p>We steamed away from <i>Heimaey</i>, passed between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
<i>Fuglasker</i> and <i>Reykjaness</i> where steam was rising from

<p class="dropcap">After searching three years, <i>Ingölfr</i> found
the storm-driven pillars cast ashore in a
steaming creek. He called the place <i>Reykjavik</i>,
the <i>Smoking Creek</i>.</p>

<p>Hardly was the anchor down in the midstream before
a rosy cheeked and genial gentleman came on
board and introduced himself as Helgi Zoëga. He
was the man with whom I had corresponded relative
to arranging our trip, providing ponies, a guide and
a pack train. To his quiet forethought and courteousness
in after days I had much for which to be thankful.
We were absolute strangers to land and people. He
took us ashore in his boat and conducted us to <i>Hotel
Island</i> where we found a comfortable, large and well
furnished room. Shortly our baggage appeared by the
same quiet agency. I then went to his office and spent
some time in going over the plan of the route to be
followed, the ponies, their equipment and the provisions
to be taken.</p>

<p>I had been judiciously forwarned by the books of
several English travellers about the snares into which
the uninitiated would fall in dealing with an Icelandic
guide so I was forearmed. I recall the quiet smile that
scarcely spread from Zoëga’s lips when I asked about
the extra straps, the extra shoes for the ponies and
the price that was to be paid at the end of the journey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the reliability of the guide and if the agreement had
not better be placed in writing to avoid misunderstanding
at time of settlement. He replied that all
was in readiness according to my wishes and his experience
and assured me of a satisfactory ending of the
journey. Let me state that in my long experience with
Mr. Zoëga and many other Icelandic gentlemen, I
was always squarely treated in small as well as in
larger matters. Never has an Icelander attempted to
take advantage of my ignorance. As far as my experience
of four summers in Iceland goes the English
statements are libels on Icelandic integrity. Could we
do business in America with the same frankness and
reliability we would need less bookkeeping, there would
be less locking of doors and less work for the courts;
we might close many of our jails and divert a whole
army of people from corrective and restraining work
into productive occupations.</p>

<p>The route decided upon, the arrangements completed
to our satisfaction, Mrs. Russell and I set out
to view the city of <i>Reykjavik</i> and receive our first impressions
of Iceland. We turned our steps in the direction
of the <i>Laug</i>, hot spring, which is about two miles
from the city square. The route is along the <i>Laugarvegur</i>,
a street with many houses of comfortable design
and good construction. The hot springs are on a
small stream running out of the meadow into the bay.
Along the route we saw many women with bundles on
their backs, boys with wheelbarrows filled with clothes
and others carrying large wicker baskets. It is the
“city laundry.” A long iron grill has been erected over
the run-way from the boiling springs to prevent accidents.
The clothes are washed in the running water
and hung up to dry on numerous lines strung in the
meadow. Commodious sheds have been erected for
protection during rain and for ironing and repairing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
garments. Great piles of wool were scattered over the
hillside to dry after being washed in the springs.
Throughout the country the hot springs are made use
of for woolwashing. The water seems to have special
properties for removing the animal grease.</p>

<p>When we had returned from our long trip across the
country in 1910 we sent a generous supply of soiled,
torn and buttonless clothes to this out-of-door laundry.
What was our amazement to find on its return to the
hotel that the buttons had been replaced and all the
rents neatly repaired. What a contrast to an American
laundry!</p>

<p>The flow of the boiling water is quite constant
throughout the year and the temperature is constant.
My thermometer registered 95°C in the runway. Considerable
steam rises from the water and when the air
is still it is most difficult to obtain an unclouded photograph.
The water is impregnated with hydrogen sulfid
and a little carbon dioxid. This is true of most of the
hot springs in the country.</p>

<p>On our return to the city we passed near the Leper
Hospital, an excellent modern structure located near
the sea. None but physicians are allowed admission to
visit. While the Teutonic races are quite free from
this ancient disease, nevertheless it does exist in Norway,
around the shores of the Baltic, in Iceland, Scotland
and in those portions of the United States settled
by Scandinavians. It seems to effect islands and sea-coasts
and because of this it is often stated that the
disease in Iceland has been perpetuated by eating
tainted fish in times of famine. Credit is due the
physicians of Iceland in not only controlling the plague
but in actually obtaining a steady decrease. This disease
goes hand in hand with tuberculosis, that is,
lepers are usually tubercular. Until recently tuberculosis
was prevalent in Iceland owing to the damp and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
unventilated houses especially on the farms. Thanks
to the energetic crusade of the Icelandic doctors the
conditions are rapidly improving and both leprosy and
tuberculosis are decreasing. The Surgeon-General,
Guðmundur Björnsson, told me with considerable pride
that the percentage of tuberculosis in Iceland was now
less than in Europe or the United States.</p>

<p><i>Reykjavik</i> is pleasantly situated on the north side of a
headland projecting into <i>Faxafjörðr</i>. There are two
high hills in the city up which the city is slowly creeping.
The ancient portion of the city is on the level ground
along the waterfront. It is not the untidy and ill-smelling
place that many English writers would have us believe.
On the contrary it is clean, the streets are wide and well
kept, running water has been brought from a distance
of eight miles to the capital. The fish curing is confined
to the shore as it is in all the coast towns and it
is not offensive. Indeed I might cite worse conditions
in the fishing centers of Old England and New England.
Many a street in Edinburgh, London, Boston
and New York is in worse sanitary condition than the
meanest streets of <i>Reykjavik</i>. The stores are numerous
and well stocked with European and American
wares. Two of the emporiums rise to the dignity of
apartment stores, where the necessities of life as well
as many of its luxuries may be obtained. The small
shops are numerous where specialties are carried such
as shoestores, tobacconists, dairy products and stationery
shops. Telegraph and telephone connect the capital
with all the towns and many of the isolated farms.
The submarine cable which lands at <i>Seyðisfjörðr</i> connects
the island with the world beyond. A modern gas
plant supplies illumination for the city and a convenient
fuel.</p>

<p>The population is a little less than 12,000 and has
rapidly increased during the past fifty-eight years under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the influence of the new life that has come to Iceland
since in 1854 the people obtained commercial liberty.
In 1874 Iceland got its constitution which was amended
in 1903 to the effect that the Governor must be an
Icelander and reside in <i>Reykjavik</i>. To all intents Iceland
is an independent, self-governing republic with a
liberal constitution. The following is a brief outline of
the government.</p>

<p>It has a constitution. It is governed by the <i>Althing</i>,
a legislative body composed of a Senate with fourteen
members and a House of Representatives of twenty-six
members. These forty members are chosen by popular
ballot and when they assemble they choose the fourteen
senators from their own number. Until 1911 six of the
senators were appointed by the King of Denmark under
the direction of the Icelandic Governor. This virtually
gave the Governor the control of the Senate. This is
now abolished. This same constitutional amendment
completely enfranchises the women.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court is located in <i>Reykjavik</i> and
consists of two judges and a Chief Justice. Their
decision may be appealed to the Supreme Court of Denmark.
The King of Denmark has a veto over the acts
of the Icelandic Parliament but so far it has never been
exercised. With this exception and the lack of the
power to make treaties, the country is virtually an independent
republic under a fair and liberal constitution.
Some of the progressives desire a step further and
would entirely sever themselves from Denmark. Owing
to their defenseless condition and the inroads of
the French and English upon the fishing grounds it will
be wise to keep the protection of Denmark for some
years.</p>

<p>There are several excellent buildings in the capital.
The more modern ones such as the <i>Thinghüs</i>, Government
Building, the <i>Safnahüs</i>, Library, are pleasing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
architecture and solid in construction. The <i>Thinghüs</i>
is situated on one side of the public square close to
the Cathedral. Its interior is well arranged for legislative
purposes and the decorations are simple, dignified
and relieved with slight ornamentation. It contains many
good paintings by Danish masters. There is a young
school of Icelandic painting and some of the works are
in this building. If Baedeker were writing a guide to
<i>Reykjavik</i> he would double star “The Lögberg,” a view
towards <i>Hengil</i>. There are several portraits of the
Danish Kings and an excellent one of Jon Sigurðsson,
the man who holds the same place in the hearts of the
Icelanders that George Washington holds in ours and
for the same reason. He is the Father of modern Iceland
but he won the constitution without bloodshed.
There is a painting by Otto Bache, “The Killing of
Thoranin by Skarpðin.” Special notice should be taken
of “The Ride of the Valkyrie” by P. Arbo. It is a
wonderful conception and is full of action. Here also
is a grand piece of wood carving made entirely with
a jackknife by an Icelandic farmer as a memorial to
Jon Sigurðsson. It is in the form of a frame to a
pier glass and a pier stand. It is equal in design and
execution to that famous carved pulpit in St. Gudule at
Brussels, which was made by Verbruggen in 1669.
There is an excellent bronze of Jonas Hallgrimsson
who died in 1845. On leaving the <i>Thinghüs</i> the custodian
gave us a friendly smile and a cordial handshake.
This treatment is refreshing after the customary request
for the shilling, the mark or the franc as is the
common experience elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Government House which contains the executive
offices is older and much more simple in design. There
are two banks in the city and one of them is housed
in its own building, which was the finest in Iceland until
the completion of the <i>Safnahüs</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>This building houses over 80,000 bound volumes
besides 6,000 manuscripts, many of them priceless.
For a city of less than 12,000 people this is a good sized
library. A thorough examination of the bookshelves
and the lists of the book charges yields abundant evidence
of the inborn aptness of this people for education.
Mind culture reaches a high level. It is pleasing to an
American to note Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary in
a prominent position and a well used set of the works
of the Sage of Concord, Ralph Waldo Emerson. The
library contains a well balanced collection of history,
literature, science, philosophy, poetry and economics,
not only in the native language but in all the spoken
tongues of Europe. For the benefit of those who do
not read English there are translations of our masterpieces
of drama, poetry and romance. I was pleased
to note the evidence of much use of the American classics
and almost the entire absence of that great class of
light reading which lumbers our bookstalls, follows us
on the train and burdens the card catalogs of the American
libraries.</p>

<p>The basement shelters the collections of natural history
and that portion devoted to Icelandic birds is practically
complete. The botanical collection is far from
complete and awaits the labor of some enthusiastic collector.
I have seen in an isolated home far from the
influence of the University a collection made by a boy
that surpasses this one in the National Library. The
collection of the minerals and lavas of the country forms
a good nucleus and that is all. It seems strange with
all the opportunities for work that some Icelandic
geologist does not complete the work so well begun
by Thorvaldur Thoroddsen. This man has produced
an excellent geological map, as nearly complete as one
man could possibly make it, considering the difficulties
of travel and the miscellaneous character of the lavas.
Most of the work on this topic has been done by Danes
and Germans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>On the upper floor of the <i>Safnahús</i> there is a large
and valuable collection of Icelandic antiquities. No
visitor to Iceland, who would get a glimpse of the
early times in the country, should miss this collection.
When he has seen it, it will then be necessary to go to
Copenhagen to view the remainder. Many of the finest
things were taken there decades since. As a salve to its
conscience the Danish treasury pays annually to Iceland
the sum of $15,600 as “interest” on the borrowed treasures.
Among the items of value we enumerate the
following,—A wooden crucifix taken from a lava cave
and supposed to be a Culdee relic from the days antedating
the settlement by the Norse; enamelled and jewelled
crucifixes from the thirteenth century; many weapons
from the eleventh and twelfth centuries such as halberds,
bills, two handed swords, spears and daggers;
female wearing apparel from many centuries, brocaded,
embroidered and variously adorned with filigree work
in silver and gold; snuff horns of ivory and “horns”
for mead and ale variously and richly carved; tapestry,
very old, that would bring a fabulous price in the great
museums of Europe; riding costumes, bridles, saddles
and a great variety of wooden boxes, bowls and foot
boards ornately carved. Here also is preserved the
first Bible printed in Iceland bearing the date of 1584.
It was printed at <i>Hólar</i> by Bishop Gudbrand Thorlaksson
who translated it from the German of Martin
Luther and carved with his own hand most of the blocks
that illustrate it. This Bible was reprinted at <i>Hólar</i> in
1644 and the edition was limited to 1000 copies. The
writer counts himself fortunate to possess a copy of this
ancient book, which was presented to him by an Icelandic
friend. It is the work of Bishop Thorlak and
is translated directly from the Greek and Latin to correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
some errors in Thorlaksson’s translation from the
German. It is the first Bible to have the text divided
into verses.</p>

<p>The religion of Iceland is Lutheran and is connected
with the state. There are three Bishops in the country,
the head Bishop is at <i>Reykjavik</i> and this man must go
to Copenhagen to be ordained. The Bishop of <i>Reykjavik</i>
goes to <i>Hólar</i> or to <i>Skálholt</i>, dwelling-ridge, in
the seats of the secondary Bishops to ordain them respectively.
At the age of fourteen the children are confirmed
and at that time must possess a good knowledge
of reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, natural history
in general, Icelandic history in detail and general
history both ancient and modern. The Cathedral at
<i>Reykjavik</i> is a very plain and uninteresting building and
would disappoint the stranger did he not know that the
Icelander is unpretentious in his religion. It is the internal
and not the external qualities that appeal to him.
The building contains one of Thorvaldsen’s masterpieces,
a font which was presented to the nation by this
famous son of Iceland. In the square which is close to
the Cathedral and the <i>Thinghüs</i> there is a large statue
of Albert Thorvaldsen. It is appropriately mounted
on a stone pedestal and was the gift of the people of
Copenhagen at the national celebration of 1874.</p>

<p>Denmark claims Thorvaldsen as her son. The facts
are as follows, and the reader may choose for himself
the country to which he really belongs. His father was
an Icelander, a wood carver, his mother was a Dane,
the daughter of a parson. Albert Thorvaldsen was
born at sea midway between Denmark and Iceland. Porcelain
copies of his <i>Dawn</i> and <i>Evening</i>, bas reliefs, are
set into many tombstones in <i>Reykjavik</i>. The dead
white of the porcelain is in fine contrast to the cold grey
of the stone. This method of ornamenting a tombstone
is unique and is not without a fine touch of sentiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The University includes the Medical College, the
Theological Seminary, the Law School besides the Liberal
Arts. Medical graduates, before taking up their
labors in Iceland must spend at least six months in clinical
work in some approved hospital in Copenhagen.
The reason is obvious. There are fifty doctors in the
employment of the government and scattered throughout
the country. They are all directly in charge of the
Surgeon General. There is little done in science at
the University. Students who wish to become proficient
in any of its numerous branches must go to the Universities
of Europe. Within the city there are also a Commercial
School, a Nautical School and a Female High
School besides the Grammar School and the common
schools.</p>

<p>There are about fifteen newspapers published in the
city and several magazines. Most of the papers are
weeklies. Among these periodicals we note a Theological
Journal, an Agricultural Paper, a Good Templar
Journal, the “War Cry” and a Woman Suffragist
Journal. No mention is here made of the essays, romances,
<i>Sagas</i>, translations and poetry published in the
city. In the bookbinding establishments the work is
done by hand and it is efficient. Honest work goes with
every stitch.</p>

<p>There are two comfortable hotels in the city and several
small boarding houses. <i>Hotel Ísland</i> is a temperance
house and is kept by a group of Good Templars.
<i>Hotel Reykjavik</i>, which is more modern, supplies
liquors. In 1909 a law was passed which forbids the
importation of any liquors after 1912 and prohibits the
sale of all alcoholic beverages after 1915. This is the
work of the Good Templars and the anti-prohibitionists
are trying to get it repealed before 1915. The service
at the hotels is excellent and one dines to the accompaniment
of the minor music of Iceland by an orchestra.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
The table surely does not lack variety and abundance is
the rule. The bill of fare is after the Danish mode.
One may choose from at least a dozen different dishes
of meats and cured fish at breakfast and supper.
Smoked salmon, eaten without further cooking, pickled
fish with raw onion, anchovies, sardines, smoked herring,
the breast of goose smoked and pressed with spices,
duck eggs in a variety of modes, rye bread and coffee,
the finest brew in the world, are among the appetizers
with which one breaks his fast at ten in the morning.
About two in the afternoon there is a real dinner. It
is prefaced with a sweet soup of a purple hue and surprisingly
palatable, then comes fish cooked to perfection,
vegetables and a roast, usually mutton or veal, and
a delicious dessert. The coffee is taken in the reception
room or in the smoking parlor as one chooses.
Oatmeal may be procured at the hotels by asking before
hand to have “porridge” cooked. In all my wanderings
through the country I never found it except at
one farm. The supper at seven is a repetition of the
breakfast. Coffee and cakes may be had at any time
at a moment’s notice. Coffee is also brought to the
room about seven in the morning. This with rusks is
taken in bed and one is supposed to take the “coffee nap”
afterwards.</p>

<p><i>Reykjavik</i> is the commercial metropolis and the
larger industries center here, although <i>Akureyri</i> is the
clearing house for the north coast. These are the centers
for exporting the fish, mutton, butter, wool, skins,
etc. Nearly all the handicrafts are represented in the
capital. There is a woolen mill where <i>vaðmal</i>, an Icelandic
cloth, is woven, a sawmill dresses the crude lumber
brought from Norway. There are several silversmiths
who equal the artists of Europe in delicate engraving
and in filigree as well as enamelling. One man
has discovered a process, which he wisely keeps secret,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
for coloring the precious metals.</p>

<p>The foreign Consuls resident in <i>Reykjavik</i> are only
two, one from France and the other from Norway.
The following countries are represented through Icelanders
who are appointed by the foreign governments,
England, Germany, Sweden, Belgium and Holland.
The United States has no representation whatever.</p>

<p>The Thorvaldsen Bazar is an attractive place, verging
upon a museum of antiquities. It is coöperative
and the proceeds go to a charity. It is conducted by
groups of ladies who give their time. Many women
on the farms knit stockings, mittens, gloves, make skin
shoes, embroidery in linen and send the items to the
bazar to be sold on commission. There are also exposed
for sale stuffed birds, minerals, odd items such as
footboards, horn spoons, snuff horns, skyr bowls and a
great variety of other items that have long been hoarded
by families in the interior. Some of the carved pieces
of wood are of great age and the carving is artistically
done. The foot board is of interest and as reference to
it will be made later in connection with the homes of the
people I will describe the one which now adorns my
guest room wall. It is made of Norway spruce, four
feet long and seven inches wide. It is ornately carved
on both sides. On one side there are three circles five
and one half inches in diameter, one at each end and
one in the middle. The circles are cut to represent
<i>Balder’s brá</i>, marguerite, which blooms abundantly
throughout the country near the coast. The central
circle shows only the ends of the numerous petals while
the center of the circle is used for engraving the name
and the date, 1868. Between the two circles at either
side of the center a prayer is carved in the <i>Ogam rune</i>.
On the reverse side there is a series of six prows of
the Viking ship. The design of the prow of the ancient
ship lends itself well to the wood carver and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
appears in a variety of forms on the ancient as well as
the modern pieces. There is an expert wood carver
in <i>Reykjavik</i> and it is well worth while to visit Stefán
Eiriksson in his workshop. I have before me a <i>skyr
áskr</i>, bowl for curds. In old times each person had
his own <i>áskr</i> which he carved to suit his fancy. This
one is completely covered with fine carving. The handles
represent dragons and to the back of one with a
wooden hinge is attached the cover. The center of the
cover is carved to represent <i>Balder’s brá</i>. It is a beautiful
piece of work and is carved out of a solid piece of
the Iceland birch.</p>

<p>There are several good photographers in the city and
one of them, M. Ólafsson, has made excellent stereoscopic
views of the natural wonders of Iceland. He
has travelled over most of the country to obtain the
negatives and he made his own stereoscopic camera as
well as the different cameras in his studio. There are
several shops where good photographs may be obtained.
The city has an excellent public bath with
steam, shower, hot and cold water. There are two
hospitals, Chemist’s shops, (drug stores), barbers, in
fact every thing required in civilized life.</p>

<p>We know so little of Iceland. Its very name suggests
all the cold and inhospitable conditions of the north
and the stranger unread in Icelandic conditions has
many a surprise in store. The worst thing I know
about Iceland is its name. It should have been christened
<i>Fireland</i>.</p>

<p>The climate of Iceland is exceedingly mild in winter
and in the summer it never gets very warm. The annual
mean temperature of the extreme north is about
2°C. lower than in the south. The climate changes
very little with the latitude but more with the glaciers,
the coast and the solfataras. The following table, compiled
from the Meteorological Records at <i>Berufjörðr</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
will convey a good idea of the conditions in the country.
This table covers <i>twenty-five</i> years for the Max. and
Min. temperatures. The station is in Long. 14° 15´
W., Lat. 64° 40´ N. and it is 55 feet above the sea.
The temperatures are given in degrees <i>Centigrade</i>.</p>

<p>When we recall that <i>zero</i> on the Centigrade thermometer
is the <i>freezing point</i> these figures will correct our
erroneous ideas of the extreme low temperatures which
we have ever associated with <i>Iceland</i>. The lowest
temperature in twenty-five years at this station was
only <i>nine and one half degrees below zero</i> on the
Fahrenheit scale. During the summer of 1910 I travelled
in the north and crossed the country in the vicinity
of the western glaciers and the lowest temperature recorded
during six weeks was 32°F. in a mountain pass
in the north and the highest was 56°F. the mean for
the entire time was 44°F. All these temperatures
were taken in the shade at 7 A. M., Noon and 9 P. M.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>At the summer solstice the midnight sun is just visible
in the south and at longer periods in the north on
the table lands. Even after the sun has set, it is as
light as day and one can read at midnight in the houses
during several weeks.</p>

<p>In a country so diversified with sea, glaciers, naked
volcanoes, uplands and rivers the sunsets are glorious.
Many nights have I climbed the hill back of the city
at eleven to watch the sunset and to be present at the
ushering in of the dawn. Below me lay the dreaming
city with here and there a strolling couple by the waterside.
South and east the scattered peaks of the Fire
Peninsula, though twenty miles distant they seemed in
the clear atmosphere to be near at hand and the purple
perfect cone of <i>Keilir</i>, Tusk, stood apart, a guardian of
the fire group beyond. Behind me stretched the long
and precipitous table land of <i>Esja</i>, its slopes scarred
and ragged and the patches of pale green sphagnum
marking the location of the water pockets in the debris.
It was crowned with a heavy cap of ice and the fluttering
folds of fog hung over it like the bridal veil of
an Icelandic maid. To the west and north is spread
the broad and glimmering bay of <i>Faxa</i> while sixty miles
beyond, though appearing less than half that distance,
<i>Snaefells Jökull</i> at the head of its regiment of volcanic
cones towers from the sea.</p>

<p>It is midnight, local time. The sun has been in
his ocean bath for thirty minutes and in an equal
length of time he will emerge near by the locality of
his plunge. It is an entrancing scene and recalls the
Twilight of the Gods. The heavens are overcast with
a rose-flesh hue of varying tones. No stars dot the
bending dome, no moon skirts the far horizon. The
<i>Faxa</i> is like a molten sea of precious metal and across
it roll billows of purple light which striking the base of
<i>Keilir</i>, surge to its pointed summit in waves of lighter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
hue to break in confusion on the distant volcanoes.
<i>Esja</i> catches the color of the sky, its dripping parapet
glistens as at noon and its ice mantle is transformed
into rosy quartz. The crowning glory of the moment
is <i>Snaefells</i>. Behind it is the sun. A broad streamer
rises vertically to the zenith from behind the mountain.
It splits the warmer shades with a band of saffron. It
spreads outward like an opening fan. <i>Snaefells</i> is the
jewel in the end of the fan handle. The fan unfolds
until a full quadrant of the heavens have turned to
gold with radiating streaks of crimson. The ice-cap
has become a ruby and <i>Esja</i> a fiery opal. Kaleidoscopic
is the change. Like the Borealis the colors
come and go, the mists open and close and the tints
deepen. <i>Esja</i> lives doubly in the bosom of the fiord
within whose shadow the fishing fleet rock gently at
their moorings. Even the ribbons of mist are imaged
in the sea and in those vast depths drift softly like the
real ones of the upper air. The cone of <i>Keilir</i> brightens,
the slumbering tints burst into fire, the fire resolves itself
into white light. The sun has risen from its midnight
bath, morning has come and I seek the hotel conscious
that neither pen nor brush can catch the true
values of this great harmony of colors, that it is impossible
to set it to meter or spread it upon the canvas.
But it lives indelibly in the soul of the poet, the painter
and the musician. Yes it is music, a great symphony,—</p>

<p class="dropcap">We had expected to start on our tour through
the south of Iceland at eight in the morning.
It was ten when we left the enclosure
where the ponies were saddled
and the pack horses laden. There were eight
ponies in the troup, two pack ponies, two riding ponies
for each of us and two for the guide. If the riding is
easy the ridden ponies are changed midway of the days
ride. If the road is difficult the ponies are changed
twice. Our guide was Johannes Zoëga, the uncle of
Helgi. He was nearly seventy years of age and as
spry as a youth of twenty. Since he was fifteen he had
followed the trails and he knew every path we crossed.
Never was he in doubt in the network of trails on the
moors or in the valleys but rode rapidly ahead at the
crossings and turned the leading pony into the right
path. Johannes was fully six feet tall and his favorite
pony was the smallest in the string. On rough ground or
in the deep ruts, it was amusing to watch his attempts
to keep his feet off the ground. He spoke English
quite well and understood it better than he spoke it. He
was a thorough gentleman, waited upon us unceasingly
and made our trip most enjoyable.</p>

<p>When I saw the ponies which were to carry us over
so many miles of rough country, up the lower slopes
of lava-blistered <i>Hekla</i> and across the bridgeless rivers,
I thought that the diminutive beasts would not be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to do the work. I felt ashamed to ask the little fellows
to carry my hundred and eighty pounds. I mentioned
the matter to Mr. Zoëga. He smiled and said
they would do the work required of them in an entirely
satisfactory manner. They did. It was our first
experience in the saddle, nor had I been on a horse since,
as a small boy, I was accustomed to ride bare-back to
a mountain pasture in New Hampshire to salt and
count the sheep. It proved to be just as well, for no
matter what may be one’s horsemanship in other lands
and on other steeds, with the Icelandic <i>hestr</i> conditions
are different and one must first put aside his acquired
ideas of horsemanship and be governed by new
conditions and experiences.</p>

<p>Johannes tied the five loose ponies together with a
string that seemed ludicrously inadequate. It is customary
in passing through a village to tie a small cord
around the under jaw of a pony and fasten the other
end of this cord to a knot in the tail of the next pony.
We started into the main street and turned towards
<i>Thingvellir</i>, Valley-of-the-Parliament, with Johannes
in the lead with the five ponies. He soon had them
all in a trot but do our best our ponies would only
walk and then on the side of the street that seemed
to please them best. It was an uncomfortable experience,
this first exhibition of horsemanship on the main
thoroughfare in the busiest portion of the day with the
people leaving their work or running to the doorways
to watch the Americans. Possibly it was our strange
costumes, made for the occasion, which attracted their
attention as these never failed to do in the interior.
We were pleased to think of it this way. After half a
mile of this aimless walking we caught up with the
guide who was waiting, as he said,—</p>

<p>“It is not good for guide to let party get out of
sight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>He straightened out his tangled string of ponies and
with a sharp “hót—hót” was away at a smart pace.
<i>Hót</i>—<i>hót</i>, <i>hót</i>—<i>hót</i>! I shouted, in this my first Icelandic,
and I said it so vigorously and with so many
different accents that I must have got it right once, for
away we went in good fashion and held our own at the
heels of the train till we reached the <i>Elliðaár</i>, Ship-River.
This is three miles out of the city and a famous
salmon river the rights to which are annually purchased
by a group of English sportsmen.</p>

<p>We stopped to rest the ponies. This is frequently
necessary, especially when first starting on a long trip
and always in the morning. Better accustomed to the
saddle we rode on with much enjoyment of the novelty
and with exhilaration, little thinking what those saddles
had in store for us before that day’s ride came to
a close. Somewhere along this portion of the route I
lost my riding belt. Deciding to do without it I refrained
from returning in search. Three weeks later
this belt was handed to us one evening, it having been
sent on from farm to farm. Twelve miles out from
<i>Reykjavik</i> we came to the last inhabited dwelling we
were to see before night. It is at the branching of
the post road from the <i>Thingvellir</i> road. It is a place
for light refreshments, much resorted to on Sundays
and holidays by the young people out riding. The
ponies were turned into the little compound provided
for that purpose and we entered and partook of milk,
excellent coffee and cakes. Over a year later, on our
way down from the north coast, we called at this same
place and this time we rode into the yard in true Icelandic
style. No matter how careful the Icelander is
of his pony, and he favors him all he can, it is a matter
of pride to enter a village or ride up to a lonely farm
at a keen gallop. As my last guide, Ólafur said,—“With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
reins tight and head up.” To tighten the reins
on an Icelandic pony is to put him into a gallop.</p>

<p>We were now ascending the divide. Every kilometer,
(the frequently travelled routes have a stone
marker placed every five kilometers), brought us to
higher ground, with an ever increasing view. Looking
backward, as the ponies climbed the steep gradient,
we caught many glimpses of the smiling <i>Faxafjörðr</i>.
The ice crown of <i>Snaefells Jökull</i> loomed larger though
we were going from it. Several small lakes, of glacier
origin, nestle in the vales to the north marked with a
ring of verdant grass about them. The country through
which we are passing is mostly devoid of grass and it
is difficult to find sufficient feed for the ponies and we
regulate our stops accordingly. This is a desolate,
dreary country, piled with blocks of frost-riven lava
which time has graciously covered with a mantle of
lichens. The whimbrels made their appearance and
stayed with us throughout the summer whenever we
rode the heather. They are noisy birds, swooping overhead
uttering their prolonged calls, or running along the
trail ahead of the ponies and then perching upon a
lichen-encrusted rock to be lost to view except to the
close observer. Their colors blend perfectly with their
surroundings. Of all the curios which we brought back
from Iceland nothing reminds us more of our journeys
than the long-billed whimbrel which is perched above
our bookcases.</p>

<p>The snow-capped peaks of <i>Esja</i> stand out in bold relief,
directly in front rises the dome of <i>Skálafell</i>, Hall-Mountain,
to the right in the distance, we catch glimpses
of the mountain summits at the southern end of
<i>Thingvallavatn</i>, Lake-in-the-Valley-of-the-Parliament,
which loom higher and higher as we climb the ridge.
While in the midst of our contemplation of the scenery,
the packs on one of the ponies loosened, the swinging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
boxes startled him into a frightened gallop which he
maintained across the heath till he had freed himself
of all the burden. After some time the debris was collected
and there being a patch of good grass here, we
stopped to rest the ponies, repair the damage and take
our first lunch in the open. Saddles and bridles were
thrown off, the cases opened and we sat down to a canned
lunch with hunger for the sauce. The opened lid
of the packing box makes an excellent table.</p>

<p>“Is this not glorious?” questioned Mrs. Russell.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied as I shied my first sardine tin at a
whimbrel. “This is living, true enjoyment. Rain or
shine, we are out for one long holiday and it will be
a glorious one.”</p>

<p>It was a picture that I should have photographed,
that first lunch upon the mountain slope,—the ponies
feeding around us untethered, the whimbrels circling
closely above our heads, the plover calling from the
heather, mountains upon mountains all around, blue
with the distance or white with their perpetual snow
mantles, the fleecy clouds drifting softly across the blue
sky,—and then those things the camera can not catch,—the
comfort of the sprawl upon the blooming heather,
the respite from the galling saddles, the chocolate for
those who do not enjoy the pipe and the pipe for those
who do. We began to get acquainted with Johannes.
As he filled his pipe with real American tobacco he
told us of the many parties he had guided, how the
English differed from the Danes, and the Germans from
either of them in their likes and dislikes of the country,
which required the most waiting upon and those who
seemed the most grateful for the attentions he paid.</p>

<p>“Did you ever act as guide for Americans before?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Before? Are you from America, the United
States?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>We assured him that we had that pleasure, whereupon
Johannes continued,</p>

<p>“Do you know Mr. ⸺ and Mr. ⸺?
No? Well, they were likely lads and lively and we
had a grand time upon our trip. See this whip?”</p>

<p>Whereupon he displayed the peculiar riding whip
of Iceland. It consists of a stock about fourteen inches
long heavily mounted with silver ferules and with a
large silver knob oval in shape at the end. To the end
of this stock is attached a strap of good leather three
feet long. It is not so much used to whip the pony one
is riding as to snap at the ponies that are tempted from
their straight and narrow way by a choice bit of grass.</p>

<p>“When those boys got back to <i>Reykjavik</i> they presented
me with this fine whip and I have carried it
ever since.”</p>

<p>Two years later I was lecturing in New York City
and chanced that night to show on the screen a slide
in which Johannes figured. He loomed up splendidly
from his tiny steed and presented a fine appearance
with his flowing beard and slouched hat tipped to one
side and with the beloved riding whip displayed in
characteristic fashion. At the close of the lecture a
gentleman approached me and asked,</p>

<p>“Did you have Johannes Zoëga for your guide? I
thought I recognized him in one of the pictures.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “he was our guide during our first
trip in the country.”</p>

<p>“He was my guide and I presented him with that
whip.”</p>

<p>The world is not so large after all.</p>

<p>Johannes then turned to Mrs. Russell and asked,</p>

<p>“What shall I call you? Your man’s name is Russell
shall I call you ‘madam’ or what?”</p>

<p>She replied, “You may call me ‘madam’ or ‘Mrs. Russell,’
whichever you choose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“What,” replied Johannes, “your name Russell and
your Man’s name the same? Two people, man and
wife, and same name?”</p>

<p>We then informed him that in the United States
when a woman married she dropped her maiden name,
or substituted it for her middle name and assumed the
surname of her husband. This was difficult for Johannes
to understand, inasmuch as in Iceland a woman
always keeps her maiden name, even after marriage.
A woman is named thus, <i>Sigurður Eiricksdóttir</i>, or,
<i>Johanna Stefánsdóttir</i>, and she is always called the
“daughter of her father.” Likewise a man is the “son
of his father” and is named accordingly. Thus, <i>Stefán
Kristófersson</i>, or, <i>Björn Eyvindsson</i>, <i>Björn</i> the son of
<i>Eyvind</i>. Now when this “son” comes to have a son
and wishes to name him he may choose any Christian
name he pleases but <i>he must be</i> “his son.” Thus if
<i>Björn Eyvindsson</i> were to name his son he might call
him Geir, Helgi, Ólafur, etc., but the patronymic would
be dropped and he would be called <i>Björnsson</i>. <i>Ólafur
Björnsson</i> would be the son of <i>Björn Eyvindsson</i>.</p>

<p>When we were through with our discussion of
nomenclature it would have been difficult to have told
which party was the more mystified.</p>

<p>The pack saddles were replaced, the fresh ponies
saddled and we started upon the second stage of the
day’s journey. Soon we mounted to the top of the ridge
which is 1,100 feet above the sea. Near the sixth kilometer
stone, about eighteen miles, we came to the <i>Saeluhús</i>,
fortunate-house, an unoccupied hospice in the deserts
and mountains for the refuge of travellers who may
be unexpectedly overtaken by a storm, especially in
winter when the snow is fiercely driven across the moors.
To cross in the blinding storm is to invite death. This
one is a small stone structure. During our following
summer we found several of these and in one of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
we were glad to take refuge.</p>

<p>This is the <i>Mossfellsheiði</i>, Moss-Mountain-Heath,
the undisturbed home of the whimbrel and the golden
plover. Before the road was built to <i>Thingvellir</i> there
were a few scattering cairns to guide the traveller.
There are at present many lofty cairns beside the way
so that even in the drifting snow the traveller may find
his way in winter. In the nearer view there is nothing
but the barren land, the gray monotony of the moor and
the eye of the traveller is held by the glories of the distant
mountains.</p>

<p>The change of ponies was no doubt beneficial to those
we had ridden in the morning and they trotted ahead
with every sign of contentment, however, it brought
no relief to the novices in the saddle. We were too
weary to put the fresh mounts to a gallop and the jog,
jog, jog on the hard road with the resulting thump,
thump, thump on the saddle slightly damped the ardor
of the first portion of the ride. We had just read Hall
Caine’s <i>Bondman</i> and named our first relay of steeds
after the two chief characters in that volume, Michael
Sunlocks and Greba. My <i>hestr</i>, Michael Sunlocks, was
a light chestnut with heavy forelocks, mane and tail of
a beautiful silvery whiteness, the forelocks would have
blinded him had they not been carefully fastened to
the bridle, the mane reached to his knees and his heavy
tail swept the ground. He was plump and mettlesome.
To describe an Icelandic <i>hestr</i>, saddle horse, as fat
is not describing him at all. I have never seen one in
poor condition. Greba was a deep bay mare of gentle
spirit. They proved to be personifications of those two
characters in the <i>Bondman</i>. What did it matter to us
if Johannes called them by unpronounceable names? To
us they were ever Michael and Greba, and they came
to know their new names. Now it happens that the
<i>Bondman</i> is founded upon the attempt of a renegade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Dane, Jorgen Jorgensen by name, to produce a revolution
in Iceland in 1809. Here then was an appropriate
name for my second mount and Jog Jogensen he was
christened. He was a fiery little beast with plenty of
grit as I found out after I had really learned to ride
a <i>hestr</i>.</p>

<p>A charming landscape burst suddenly into view. The
largest of Icelandic lakes, <i>Thingvallavatn</i>, is spread
like a mirror below the bluffs. Its forty square miles
of water are enclosed with scenic, basaltic headlands,
its surface broken only by two islands, small and extinct
craters. We saw it at its best. Long bands of
pearly cloud lay athwart the mountain range while
cloud and mountain cone lived doubly in the emerald
green. Our weary spirits rose the more we advanced,
most of the monotonous moorland stretched in gray
billows behind us, and the discomfort of the saddle
was momentarily forgotten. When it seemed that we
were going directly to the shore of the lake the road
took a sharp bend to the left and we descended a gulley
to a big brook. We scorned the iron bridge and turned
the ponies into the stream to quench their thirst. The
water being low, we forded.</p>

<p>At six P. M. we turned from the highway into the
turf-walled lane leading up to the farm called <i>Kárastaðir</i>,
literally, the-farm-of-sickness. Why it was thus
named is evident in the name but that was many centuries
since. It must be remembered that the names of
the farms and all the place-names are the same to-day
as they were christened a thousand or more years ago.
Every place in Iceland was most appropriately named.</p>

<p><i>Kárastaðir</i> is a pleasant farm located besides a noisy
brook on the upland slope of the lakeshore. It is approached
between parallel walls of turf. These turf
walls also enclose the <i>tún</i>, the mowing land, or the home
field. They are made of turf cut in long thick strips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and placed in layers. The walls are about three feet
thick on the ground and narrow to half that width at
the top. Grass grows luxuriantly all over them and
they are often ornamented with a free sprinkling of
wild flowers. I know of no hedgerow in England
or country lane in America half so beautiful as many
of these approaches to an Icelandic farm house. Hedge
clippers, boards and concrete do not make for true
beauty. These walls become a portion of the ground,
permanent affairs that do not need attention and stand
for centuries. The Icelandic farmer can show the New
England Yankee how to build a fence, but then he has
the material in the toughest of turf. A fence in New
England built of native sods would not endure as long
as the frail brush fences of our hillside pastures. At
the far end of the lane stands the <i>hús</i>. This term
refers not only to the actual dwelling but to all the
buildings within the enclosure whether for man or
beast. This turf wall runs around the buildings so as
to make an inner plot where no entrance to the mowing
lands can be obtained by the live stock.</p>

<p>On dismounting we were cordially received. Our
ponies were unladen and taken to the pasture by a boy.
The house maids,—a proper distinction for there are
house-maids and farm-maids with corresponding duties,—busied
themselves in preparing the guest room and
the tiny bedroom leading out of it for our accommodation.
In a short time the table was spread with rye
bread, unsalted butter, cheese, broiled <i>char</i>, a species of
trout from the lake, warm milk and boiled eggs. To
this repast we did ample justice. Then followed a
pot of excellent coffee and a platter laden with a variety
of dainty cakes. This is one of the better class of Icelandic
farms. We were still on the great highway of
Iceland and under the influence of the capital city. The
house had wood floors, Norway spruce, polished and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
aged to a beautiful seal-brown and spotlessly clean. We
took our packing boxes into our bedroom as was our
custom until we became better acquainted with the
character of the people. The bedroom was eleven feet
by five. In it was a small table, washstand, three chairs,
four packing cases and two beds. When the heavy riding
boots were removed there was not much room left
in which to turn. The outer room contained a small
dining table, an organ, several chairs and many ornaments
of local interest in the shape of pictures. Every
Icelandic home, no matter how humble, has its photograph
album, long since filled and the overflow is
spread upon the wall.</p>

<p>Supper over, I visited the out-buildings, which are
entirely of stone and turf, except the roof contains
timber to give the necessary support for the brush and
turf. Near the coast and in the north this timber
is obtained from the Arctic driftwood and I have seen
many a stick of Siberian larch that has undoubtedly
drifted over the polar area and lodged upon this coast.
Thus does nature provide an abundance of building material
in a land where no timber grows. I examined
the haying implements with considerable interest and
then followed the brook up the hillside in quest of
flowers. Reclining upon a bed of the “mountain
bloom” I looked down upon the farm, across the tún
to the lake and beyond to the ragged peaks. The smoke
rose from the peat fire in the kitchen, bringing with
it the pleasing odor of burning humus, the farm maids
were busy with the milking and the men were swinging
their scythes in the meadow, albeit it was half past
nine at night. This then is Iceland, the land of my
boyhood dreams. These are the home-dwellers, who
are not city-struck nor crazed with the lust of gold.
These are the people of sturdy ways and simple lives
whom I am to know in the years to come.</p>

<p>The two beds were placed end to end on one side of
the room. Each was five feet long and not over two
and a half in width. How these six-foot men can
sleep in any comfort in five-foot beds is a mystery. The
mattress is a well stuffed feather bed, the coverlet is of
eider down. The down is stuffed into a tick like a
pillow and like a pillow it has a white case. One virtually
sleeps between two feather beds. In the nightly
struggles to kick the foot board out of my short bed,
the overgrown pillow, used as a blanket, often fell to
the floor and sometimes as a last resort to straighten out,
I followed the coverlet to the floor, used it for a mattress
and with a steamer rug slept in peace.</p>

<p>Nine in the morning found us at breakfast. An
hour later, having paid our host his modest reckoning,
with handshaking all round and a hearty <i>góðr á daginn</i>,
pronounced as though spelled <i>go-an-dine</i>, meaning literally
“good to the day,” an ancient Scandinavian salutation
and universal in Iceland for centuries, we started
to <i>Thingvellir</i>. After riding for half an hour over
the barren plain thickly studded with fragments of the
ancient basalt and with eyes steadfastly fixed upon the
beauties of the lake, we came to the brink of a mighty
chasm. Below our feet is the plain of <i>Thingvellir</i>, the
Mecca of Iceland, the seat of the ancient parliament,
the resultant of the combined freakishness of earthquake
and volcanic forces. It is a remarkable geological
formation. The sunken plain is nearly ten miles long
and five miles broad.</p>

<p>We stand on the brink of the <i>Almannagjá</i>, All-Men’s-Rift,
so named because in ancient days when the nobles
and law-makers were assembled in the plain below, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
common people met upon the heights along the brink
of this chasm for a great national holiday of about two
weeks. To our right, south-west, the sunken valley is
filled with the waters of the lake. To the left, northeast,
rises the abrupt wall of <i>Ármannsfell</i>, a lofty
mountain of trap. To the south-east, five miles away
and extending from the far side of the lake to <i>Ármannsfell</i>
is the <i>Hrafnagjá</i>, Ravens-Rift. This rift is
parallel with the one upon whose brink we are now
standing. The sunken plain varies in the depth of its
depression from twenty-five feet at the northeast to
over a hundred feet at the south-west, below the level
of the surrounding moorland. The plain itself is rent,
rifted and shattered into thousands of fragments as
if hot water had been dashed against a plate glass window
on a frosty morning. Hundreds of chasms intersect
each other in the sunken plain in a huge network.
They go deep down to the bed of the lake and the lake
follows them up under the lava and the water glimmers
at the bottom of these chasms.</p>

<p>How was this formation wrought? In prehistoric
times, that is before Iceland was discovered, how much
earlier we do not know and the rocks do not reveal the
secret save the probable period of the flowing of the
lava itself which filled all the valley, the surface
cooled and the fluid below this crust was under pressure
and forced a passage through the barrier where the
lake now lies and drained away. This left a mammoth
cavern with a hot, laminated, blistered and
shrinking roof. Time passed. The shrinking continued.
The stress became sufficient to produce the
great fault, an earthquake, and in one mighty tumble
the entire roof of the lava chamber collapsed, breaking
away from the walls which now form the moorland
side of the great parallel rifts. As it fell it was shivered
into acre-sized fragments, tilted and turned so as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
present a billowy appearance. Time has mercifully
clothed the ragged mass with verdure, tangled masses
of dwarf birch, which, from the distance of the brink
upon which we stand, soften the harsh outlines
and partially obscure the chasms. As the roof of the
cavern fell it broke away from the mountain walls on
either side of the plain and pulled the ragged mass with
it. This formed a second wall and between these two
walls runs the <i>Álmannagjá</i> on this side of the plain and
the <i>Hrafnagjá</i> on yonder side. From the top of the
inner walls the slope is gradual down into the plain,
much like the inward sloping sides of a platter. On the
moorland side enormous niches extend into the wall
and protruding from the second wall are masses of
lava pulled out of these places which would exactly fit
the ancient matrix could they be restored. These are
so numerous in each of the rifts that there is no doubt
as to the correctness of our view of the formation of
the rifts and of <i>Thingvellir</i>.</p>

<p>Over the brink of the tableland and into the <i>Álmannagjá</i>
tumbles a fine sheet of water, the <i>Öxerá</i>, Axe-River,
which follows the chasm down to a break
through the inner wall, spreads over a portion of the
plain and enters the lake. At our feet there is a narrow
side passage leading from the brink down into the
rift which has been laboriously levelled and a good road
now leads to the lower level. This pass in ancient
days was the strategic point of many a stout fight. In
the <i>Burnt Njal</i> we read a vivid description of such a
fight when the issue of the trial was unfavorable to one
of the factions.</p>

<p>We will now ride down the incline, cross the bridge
over the foaming <i>Öxerá</i> and draw rein at the <i>Valhöll</i>,
Great-Hall-of-the-King. This was erected when King
Frederick of Denmark visited the place in 1907. That
the good king toured a portion of Iceland at this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
is a blessing to travellers because special roads were
built, bridges erected and inns constructed for his accommodation.</p>

<p>We turned the ponies over to Johannes who took
them to the pasture upon the moorland above the rift.
It was only eleven in the morning and we had ridden
but an hour yet we decided to spend the day in a
further examination of this historic spot. The time
allotted proved inadequate and a year later, on our return
from the north, we passed an entire day here. Less
than half a dozen people were stopping at the <i>Valhöll</i>.
We were assigned a room like a beach bath house with
two bunks, one above the other as in a steamer. We
did not know till the next summer that this hotel had
first, second and third class lodgings. It was the only
place in Iceland where we ever found any distinction.
On our second summer we had first class accommodations,
which meant a large comfortable room with a
regulation bed and the meals served privately in the
adjoining room in place of on a bench in the large hall.</p>

<p>Immediately we set out to explore the place. A mist
was creeping in from the lake and down from the mountains.
This soon developed into a “Scotch mist”
which is an easy falling rain. We went to the <i>Öxerá</i>,
explored the deep rift between the walls, which in places
has been fenced off for sheep cotes. We climbed the
wall to the top of the falls, peered down into the numerous
fissures and were astonished to find snow at the
bottom of one of them. It is a narrow chasm, very
deep and the sun can not reach the bottom. We followed
the wall eastward for two miles where we found
a place to descend into the plain. On the return we
wandered among the crevasses, dodging blocks of lava
and jumping the narrow rifts where down a hundred
feet the water glimmered. We returned in the rain
for our mid-afternoon meal which consisted of broiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
trout from the lake. It rained vigorously and we devoted
some time to the neglected notebooks, also to an
examination of the guest book. They do not use registers,
simply a book in which the parting guest writes
his name and any comments he chooses. There is an
old Icelandic proverb which runs as follows,—</p>

<p class="center"><i>Island er hin besta land sem sól skina uppi</i>.</p>

<p class="center">Iceland is the best land on which the sun comes up (shines).</p>

<p>This was quoted over one of the signatures. A little
later some one had written an addition in German,—“<i>and
the rain rains</i>.”</p>

<p>At five in the afternoon the clouds broke away, the
sun came smilingly forth and we continued our exploration.
We visited the ducking pool, where in ancient
days women convicted of heinous crimes were drowned.
This is a big noisy basin within the <i>Álmannagjá</i> a
little way below the falls. Well would it have been
with the noble <i>Gunnar</i> had <i>Halgerða</i> been dipped in
this cauldron ere ever he became fascinated with her
beauty and caught in her toils. We crossed to the borders
of the lake where there is a small <i>tún</i>, the <i>Thingvellir</i>
parsonage. An ancient church stands within the enclosing
walls of the <i>tún</i>. We obtained the key of the
pastor and entered. Until a few years ago the churches
throughout the country were turned over to travellers
for sleeping quarters. This was a most excellent arrangement
as they afforded plenty of room and were always
well ventilated. Some English sportsmen once amused
themselves by throwing their boots at the candles on
the altar and committing other acts of vandalism and
the Bishop of Iceland very wisely forbade the future use
of the churches as accommodations for travellers. This
has put many people to inconvenience since, not only
the traveller but the farmer or pastor who has had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to discommode himself to find room in an already overcrowded
house. Thus do many people suffer for the
wanton acts of a few and a nation gets a bad name
because of the deeds of a few of its reckless sons.
Until <i>Valhóll</i> was erected the pastor at this place cared
for the strangers if they were without a tent. What
a relief to him has been this little hospice. This parsonage
figures prominently in the <i>Prodigal Son</i>, which
is Hall Caine’s best work on Iceland. It should be read
by all who contemplate a visit to this land or are interested
in the country. When he wrote the <i>Bondman</i>
he had never been in Iceland and he wrote entirely from
imagination and without any local color. This was
severely criticised in Iceland and so much fuss was
made over the misrepresentations and erroneous paragraphs
that Caine visited the country, thoroughly explored
the vicinity of <i>Reykjavik</i> and then wrote <i>The
Prodigal Son</i> which redeemed himself in the eyes of the
people. Icelanders are quite sensitive about misrepresentations
made by foreigners. Above all other things
the Icelander dreads to be laughed at, scorns falsehoods
about himself and his country and is jealous of
its reputation. This is deep seated patriotism.</p>

<p>The little church contains a very old altar piece, a
<i>Last Supper</i>, painted on wood. The altar itself
was constructed in 1683. In the yard there is a
monolith of lava erected by man. On its eastern face
there are several parallel marks cut deeply into the
stone. Like the standard <i>Meter</i> kept in Paris and the
standard <i>Yard</i> in London, these lines marked the standard
<i>alin</i>, ell, measure of linear distance in the ancient
days. It is supposed to be of the tenth century. The
measures of the country were adjusted by this standard.
Thus the Scandinavians fixed a standard of measurement
centuries before Great Britain adopted its arbitrary and
unscientific measure or the arc of a meridian had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
measured for the French scientific standard.</p>

<p>A little way from the parsonage and beside the recently
constructed road is the <i>Lögberg</i>, Mount-of-Laws.
Let us ascend it, note the surroundings and recall the
past. When the plain fell to its present irregular level
and was shattered into hundreds of misshapen masses,
here by the lake two of the chasms, like the arcs of intersecting
circles, enclosed a long oval fragment of lava
which stood high above the surrounding level and overlooked
the lake. This is the Law Mount. One of
these rifts is known as the <i>Flosigjá</i>. At one point the
walls approach within eighteen feet and it is said that
when the burner of <i>Njal</i>, Flosi, was hotly pursued by
his enemies he leaped this chasm. These chasms,
through which an underground river finds its way into
the lake, are very picturesque with their lichen encrusted
walls, with the crowberry in the niches and the
wild thyme hanging over the brink. In the old days
it was possible to reach the engirdled mount at only
one place. This made it easy of defense and secure
to the lawgivers and judges against intrusion by the
populace. Frosts and earthquakes have pried off many
an angular fragment into the gulf and the place is now
easy of access.</p>

<p>Standing on the grassy mound the great wall of
<i>Almannajgá</i> reaches its black mass from the border of
the lake to <i>Armansfell</i>, the <i>Öxerá</i> plunges in one long
white curve over the brink, boils musically within its
distant canyon and reappears through the rent in the
side of the inner wall flecked with foam. Beyond the
moorland <i>Súlur</i>, Stone-Pillars, rears his pinnacles of
basalt. <i>Thingvallavatn</i> smiles at our feet. No sail
dots its brilliant surface, no houses border its precipitous
shore. It is the same as when the <i>Saga</i> heroes
fished in its bright depths and these graceful swan and
busy ducks enjoy the same tranquility as their remote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
ancestors. Around the lake a ring of red and purple
peaks, robed in transparent atmosphere and embellished
with hues unknown in lower latitudes, peep into this
molten glimmerglass to behold each others image, while,
amid the distance-softened ridges, <i>Hengill</i> sends upward
its “columns of white vapor like altar smoke”
towards the softened sky. The embosomed isles are
skirted with green and at the waters edge are fringed
with the aromatic <i>Angelica</i>. Uncounted peaks are
around us surpliced with white raiment as though assembled
to raise one grand anthem to Nature’s God.</p>

<p>Let us turn back the pages of time 800 years. We
stand upon the upper portion of the <i>Lögberg</i>, upon the
bloodstone, where the backs of criminals were broken
before they were hurled into the abyss at our feet. The
Thingmen are in solemn assembly a little lower down
the incline. Along the brink of <i>Almannajgá</i> throng the
populace in assembled thousands in their annual August
festival, gathered from every portion of the island.
They await the issue of some vital subject under discussion
on the mound. It is the year 1112 and the
trial for the Burning of Njal is well under way. That
old man with the quiet mien and full flowing beard is
Mord. He rises, faces the Court and says,—</p>

<p>“I take witness to this, that I take a Fifth Court oath.
I pray God so to help me in this light and in the next,
as I shall plead this suit as I know to be most truthful,
and just, and lawful. I believe with all my heart
that Flosi is truly guilty in this suit, if I may bring
forward my proofs; and I have not brought money into
this court in this suit, and I will not bring it. I have
not taken money and I will not take it, neither for a
lawful nor for an unlawful end.”</p>

<p>The great trial proceeds but a flaw is found in the
pleading and the technicality destroys all that has been
gained. Now men rush to their weapons and Flosi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
would gain the Great Rift as a place of defense. Snorri,
the Priest, forsees the outcome and has quietly stationed
another hardy band at this vantage point. The throng
upon the moorland press to the brink to watch the
fierce fight waged by the contending factions, who attempt
to settle at the point of the spear the question
which has just failed in the court. Might is still
right. Doughty blows are showered as Odin chants
the warsong under the shields of his few remaining warriors.
Spear and battle axe ring loudly upon shield
and helmet. The verdict is rendered. The decree is
written in blood upon the grass. A prolonged shout
of acclamation mingled with the roar of disapproval
rises from the multitude. The clamor dies away, for
the sturdy bodies of these iron heroes, who can give
and take such blows, can endure no longer and the
struggle ends with lifelong feuds.</p>

<p>Upon the sunken plain along the banks of the <i>Öxerá</i>
stand the booths of the prominent Thingmen, the
priests, the chieftains and the poets. To these the people
assemble in noisy factions to cool their blood in long
draughts of mead. See, there by the snowy falls near
to the perpendicular wall is the booth of Snorri. Down
the river a little distance is the booth where Njal so
often gave counsel ere the burning; there by the lake
is the booth of the fair and treacherous Hallgerða. It
was here that Gunnar first spied her sitting in the doorway
fresh from her bath in the lake. The bloodshed
is not quite over, look where the river foams through its
rocky jaws, leaping in two great bounds for the lake,
impatient for <i>its</i> victims. In that surging eddy within
the rift that group of women convicted of infanticide
and adultery are now to be drowned and on that mound
where those fagots of birch are piled that witch is to
be burned.</p>

<p>The 800 years are passed. The writer stands at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
eventide alone upon the <i>Lögberg</i> and views with enchanted
eye this perfect painting of peace let down from
heaven. Mammoth and angular masses, their roughness
softened with thyme and forget-me-nots, surround
the age-old chasms and live anew in those Nile-green
depths. Peaceful it is beyond the power of description.
Here the sturdy Viking, wealthy with the spoils
of Europe, worked out a constitution, founded a republic,
sloughed off the skin of paganism, adopted on
the first ballot the Christ-law and crystallized a civilization
centuries since. Here in the old and stirring days
great minds held sway. What sturdy men they were,
mighty in feats of arms, resourceful, inventive, poetic,
pregnant with the germs of thought that in their latter
day development produced a scholastic, peaceful, Christian

grand old epics they enacted, let their Sagamen relate.</p>

<p>Beautiful Arctic flowers crown the <i>Lögberg</i>. The
plover whistles on the heather and the whimbrel calls
as in days of yore. Around this primitive parliament
flow the emerald waters in varied shades of prismic
green like polished malachite, long since unpolluted
with broken-backed criminals.</p>

<p>I fired my revolver into the green-bedded chasm of
the <i>Flosigjá</i> to awaken the echoes. Their voices betokened
peace. The angry snarl of the bloodthirsty
mob, the clash of bill on yielding armor, the wail of
drowning women no longer reverberated from chasm to
cliff. Echo had but one message, <i>Peace</i>.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Morning dawned with a gentle rain. Hour
after hour it fell with no promise of
abatement until ten, when the clouds were
rifted, the sun shone through and the dripping
plain glistened. We decided to set out for the
long ride to <i>Geysir</i>. The ponies had been in readiness
for an hour in anticipation of an earlier start.</p>

<p>We turned into the trail leading across the plain,
along the border of the lake towards <i>Hrafnagjá</i>, Johannes
following with the train at some distance. When
we reached the rift we halted to examine it until Johannes
arrived. This chasm is longer than the <i>Almannagjá</i>
but not so deep and surely not so impressive. It lacks
the beautiful waterfall and the historical associations
of the latter. It extends along the side of the mountain
which we were about to climb. Many blocks of basalt
have tumbled into it in one place and over these a suitable
and safe passage has been constructed. As we
crossed the chasm the rain began to fall, likewise the
temperature. Long before we had reached the summit
of the mountain pass the rain was pouring upon us and
rolling off in rivulets from horse and rider. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
a good test of our specially made waterproof clothing
and it stood the test. Never a drop penetrated save
up the sleeve of the bridle hand.</p>

<p>At the summit, the clouds scattered again; this time
in earnest and we experienced no more rain during the
long trip. It was just one long and glorious summer
day and we wandered care-free in full enjoyment of
the wonderful country. Near the summit we passed
a lonely little farmhouse and the people being absent in
the hayfield the lonesome dog came out to make our
acquaintance.</p>

<p>At this place the trail winds through an exceedingly
rough area of lava, tangled and twisted. It was my
first experience with recent volcanic products and it was
with absorbing interest that I examined this material,
as the ponies climbed the steep gradient and threaded
the narrow path through the labyrinth of angular
blocks. Above our heads rose a line of peaked and
jagged volcanoes, <i>Kálfstindar</i>, Calf-Peaks. This place
has been the center of considerable volcanic activity as
evidenced by the different forms of lava, i. e. lava of
different periods of eruption also by the weathering
piles of tufa and conglomerate. Near the trail there
is a peculiar formation, a <i>tintron</i>. This is a volcanic
chimney, rising about nine feet out of the lava plain.
The opening at the top is in the form of an ellipse and
the tube extends forty feet down into the solid lava.
The sides are blistered and it has the appearance of
having been a blow-hole from which thin lava was
thrown upward in the form of a fountain as water
from the nozzle of a hose. There are several of
these unique formations in the north which will be
discussed when we reach <i>Mývatn</i>.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving the <i>tintron</i>, the trail wound
downward along the side of the mountain and under
projecting cliffs of tufa and brought us suddenly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
view of the fair valley of <i>Laugardalr</i>, Valley-of-the-Hot-Springs.
An entrancing panorama was spread out
at our feet. The luxuriant green of the valley contrasted
strangely with the scorched and blistered barriers
over which we had been climbing. In the distance
a smiling lake of no mean proportions cut a
large space out of the meadows. On the nearer and
the farther shore of <i>Laugarvatn</i>, Hot-Spring-Lake,
rose columns of steam in slender spirals quivering in
the breeze and vanishing in the upper air. Numerous
sheep and cattle marked the valley with dots of
white and brown. Besides the nearer hot springs clustered
a group of farm buildings and the distance caused
their turf roofs to appear like tiny hillocks. This lake
and valley appear like a monstrous chrysoprase in a
grand setting. The valley is enclosed by the needle
spires of the volcanoes which are red, brown, yellow
and gray and streaked with a mixture of all these
colors on their naked slopes where the melting snows
have swept down many an avalanche of ash and cinder.</p>

<p>We descended by a steep path to the lower level,
passing many a towering pile of conglomerate of soft
texture and wading through many a talus of ash and
sand where the myriads of zeolites glistened. The
masses of rock protruding from the tufa cliffs give
them the appearance of huge plum puddings. Reaching
the verdant plain we changed ponies and while
waiting for them to graze, we explored a small cavern
in the base of the cinder pile. This cave has long been
used as a retreat for the sheep in times of storm. It
has since been cleaned, a turf dwelling erected before
its entrance and it now forms the home of a young
Icelandic couple who have set up their housekeeping
here since our visit. Remounting we sped away over
the meadow, crossing many small brooks and arrived
at the farm by the hot springs. This place has many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
signs of prosperity, such as the quality of the buildings,
the numerous flocks around the lake, the abundance
of hay and the thrifty patch of potatoes in its
special turfed enclosure. We were cordially welcomed,
taken to the guest room and served with hot coffee,
milk, pastry and delicious griddle cakes, large in area
and quite thin, buttered while hot, sprinkled with
sugar and then rolled tightly. We found these griddle
cakes at many of the farms and can cordially recommend
them to a dainty appetite. At the close of
the lunch we repaired to the hot springs which always
had for us an unfailing interest. They are at the very
edge of the lake and have formed small mounds of
silicious scinter mingled with lime and alum. Wherever
the hot water has fallen upon the land there is an
incrustation of fantastic form. Most of the water boils
over into the cold water of the lake. The spring furnishes
hot water for all domestic purposes and is a great
conserver of fuel. The clothes are washed in tubs beside
the springs and then rinsed in the lake. Here
the wool is cleansed before shipment. In the hot
ground the bread is baked, the dough being enclosed
in earthen jars. In a fuelless country it is a gift. It
is a strange contrast this pouring out of boiling water
in the margin of the cold lake.</p>

<p>We hastened across the meadow along the border
of the lake to regain the trail leading to <i>Geysir</i>. Hasten
is the correct word. No air was stirring and the clouds
of tiny <i>mý</i>, midges, that rose out of the long grass as
the ponies disturbed them, simply smothered us. They
filled the ears of the ponies, crowding in with the long
hair and swarmed in patches upon their flanks and
legs. Instances are related where the midges so tormented
the ponies that they rushed into the water, in
spite of the protestations of the riders, that they might
get rid of their tormenters. No horse of my knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
has his ears so completely filled with hair as the
Icelandic pony. Doubtless this is an adaptation for a
special purpose and I believe that purpose was to protect
these delicate organs from these stinging insects.
We drew forth our fly veils and put them on with some
relief, but as we did it while at a full gallop they were
not securely fastened and some of the pests got under
the netting. Here they were happy, for we could not
drive them away. In desperation I pulled off my veil,
for the express purpose of giving all the midges an
equal chance. It needed no urging to put the ponies
to their best paces, for they well understood that the
insects would leave us when we had attained an elevation
above the meadow.</p>

<p>We entered a tract of scrubby willow and dwarf
birch. Some of the birches were as high as our shoulders
while we were on horseback and thus we rode with
our heads protruding above the Icelandic forest and
there was some free advice given about getting lost in
the woods. There are two or three larger forests in
the north which we shall visit later. We passed several
good farms and every one, men, women and children
were busy with the hay harvest. Two hours
riding took us to <i>Miðdalr</i>, Middale, church, which is
close to the famous <i>Brúará</i>, Bridge-River. Many
streams rush out of the mountain gullies and unite up
this side valley. Here the <i>Brúará</i> comes foaming down
its shelving bed in a passion. Near the crossing it
spreads out in a wide sheet over the lava which is full
of ugly crevasses. One great rift, of unknown depth,
and five feet wide extends through the center of this
lava and the river tumbles into it from both sides.
Tumbling into lava rifts is a characteristic of Icelandic
rivers, some of them entirely disappear. Until the
coming of King Frederick in 1907 the traveller rode
his pony through the water for about one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
feet, carefully avoiding the cracks, with the water well
up the flanks of the pony. When the rift was reached
it was crossed on planks bolted to the rock and often
with the water flowing over them. When safely across
the “bridge” another passage of one hundred feet
through the water brought the traveller once more upon
dry ground. This is why it is called “bridge river.” A
suspension bridge now spans the stream and the view up
the river is excellent. In former days it required some
steadiness of purpose to thread this tangled maze of
cracks beneath the white water and ride the plank over
the foaming stream, and yet, I am sure, I would prefer
it to the crossing of the <i>Ölfusà</i> which we made two
weeks later.</p>

<p>Here we encountered a large party of Icelanders
with numerous pack ponies laden with provisions, timber,
and strangest of all, huge piles of fish heads with
attached vertebrae. The party had been down to the
coast to dispose of their wool and were returning with
their supplies for the summer. When the fish are
dressed the heads and backbones are cut out and hung
upon the fences to dry. In the interior they are pulverized
and used for food whenever provisions are
short. In the spring when hay becomes scarce fish
are often fed to the livestock.</p>

<p>Passing the farm, <i>Utlið</i>, the <i>out-folk</i> or the people
beyond, we wound around the shingly side of <i>Bjarnafell</i>,
Bear-Mountain,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and descended to the plain which
proved to be a bog saturated with the recent rain.
Lord Dufferin in his <i>Letters from High Latitudes</i> calls
this place “an Irish bog.” The crossing was anything
but pleasant for the ponies. Many deeply worn trails
crossed the plain towards <i>Geysir</i>. Under ordinary conditions
of dryness any one of these ditches would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
been satisfactory to the ponies, but partly filled with
mud the ponies shied at them and without any warning
frequently jumped out of one and into another before
the rider was aware of what was about to happen.
It is in places of this character that the instinct
and experience of the pony is more serviceable than
the judgment of his rider. It is in the bog, on the
rough mountain trail and in the foaming river that
the true worth and peculiar qualities of the Icelandic
pony is revealed. The ponies prefer the old ruts which
often are worn so deeply that his flanks rub the turfed
edges and the rider must pay special attention to his
own feet if he would not have them jammed into the
turf at the angles of the intersecting trails. Attempt
to get the pony out of the rut and on to what the rider
assumes is a better path, the turf, and the mettle of
the steed is immediately aroused. It requires a strong
pull upon the rein and a dig of the heel into the ribs
of the pony to get him out of the path he has chosen.
As soon as this is accomplished to the satisfaction of
the rider and he settles down in the saddle conscious of
his superior wisdom over the brute creation, without
the least warning the pony takes a side step which lands
him in the bottom of the forbidden trail. After a few
of these unexpected rebuffs the rider is content to let
the pony have the choice of trails providing it leads
in the general direction of the rider’s choice.</p>

<p>In the distance we saw columns of steam rising from
a large area and Johannes assured us that it was from
the geysers. It was here that we met an acquaintance
from the <i>Laura</i>, Mr. A. V. Manneling, a banker from
Helsingfors in Finland, whose company had been very
agreeable on the voyage from Leith to <i>Reykjavik</i>. He
informed us that <i>Geysir</i>, (pronounced gáy-sir,) had
erupted that noon and would probably give another
exhibition that evening. We bade him good-bye and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
hastened on in order to be present during the eruption.
A century ago <i>Geysir</i> was quite constant in the periods
of its eruption but owing to recent earthquakes which
have changed the conditions below it is not at all regular
and it is frequently eight days between the displays.
We forded several tributaries of the <i>Túngufljót</i>,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Tongue-River, rounded the base of <i>Laugarfell</i>, Hot-Mountain,
and rode into the midst of the steaming
acres, the site of great <i>Geysir</i> and his satellites, a
place of awful magnificence, where the water,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“… hot, through scorching cliffs is seen to rise</div>
<div class="verse">With exhalations steaming to the skies!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse right">—<i>Iliad.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We dismounted at the little inn, which is located in
the midst of the boiling and spouting caldrons, glad
to leave the saddle after a ride of thirty-five miles
across a diversified country. It had been our second
day in the saddle but we had become accustomed to
the ponies and they had discovered that the riders were
their masters. We had had an exceedingly pleasant
journey with no discomforts except those attendant
upon horseback riding through a rough and roadless
country.</p>

<p>This little inn was another creation for the benefit
of the King and again we rejoiced that his visit to Iceland
preceded ours. There are four rooms on the
ground floor, one for dining and the other three for bedrooms.
The cooking is done in a little house slightly
removed towards the mountain. Formerly all travellers
to <i>Geysir</i> took tents with them for use at this place
or hired them of the farmer at <i>Haukadalr</i>, Hawk-dale.
The Inn was crowded. There was a large company of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Icelanders out for a holiday besides several Danes,
Germans and those lovers of the <i>Laura</i>, the Swede
and the Icelandic maiden. We encountered them several
times during the summer and they were having a
happy time. It appeared to be a honeymoon preceding
the bridal. There was a prolonged conversation between
Johannes and the keeper of the Inn in which
Johannes expressed himself quite forcibly if we could
judge by the determination in his voice. He appeared
to be the victor, for he came to us with a beaming face
and showed us into one of the corner rooms next to
<i>Geysir</i>. Our luggage was brought in, a steaming supper
of boiled mutton, potatoes, milk, coffee and black
bread was set before us. That Icelandic coffee! The berries
are freshly roasted every morning, they are of prime
quality, the brewing is expertly done, the cream is real
and,—well, it is delicious. Throughout the country
it is the same. Halt at a farmhouse at any time in
the day and you are invited to <i>Coffee</i>. It is coffee
with every meal and frequent potations between meals.
In that land the coffee ghost has never risen to be
cried down with a score of cereal concoctions. Prepare
it here freshly and expertly as they do and there
is no reason why conscience should peer over the brim
of the steaming cup to bid us beware of the snare of its
fragrance.</p>

<p>We were hungry but our curiosity concerning the locality
made short work of the supper. We then
learned that the discussion in which Johannes became
so energetic was precipitated by his stipulation that no
one was to use the room except ourselves. In it there
were three single beds, bunks built against the wall,
and provisions for several more in the middle of the
room when occasion required them. We did not know
the Icelandic custom, that several men, women and
children, whether known to each other or not, sleep in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the same room without any inconvenience. The inn-keeper
did not understand why this custom should be
broken to the inconvenience of the many people who
desired shelter that night. We learned more of this
custom as our experiences multiplied and we will give
the reader a full account in a later chapter.</p>

<p>This place is marked on the map of Iceland as
<i>Geysir</i>. The word is from the verb <i>geysa</i>, “to rush
forth furiously, to burst out with violence.” It is not
applied to all the spouting springs of boiling water as
is <i>geyser</i>, the geological term, but is the name of the
king of all the spouting springs in Iceland. Scores
of these springs are located in this place but each has
a special name which is appropriate to some physical
peculiarity, such as <i>Strokr</i>, the churn, the tube where
the water rises, falls and boils vigorously as the cream
rose and fell with a frothy splutter in the ancient dash
churn. When we think of the geysers of New Zealand,
the Yellowstone National Park or any place in Iceland
we must remember that they took this name from
<i>Geysir</i>. There is only one <i>Geysir</i>.</p>

<p>The area dominated by the springs is directly at
the foot of <i>Laugarfell</i>, indeed the south side of this
mountain once formed a portion of the hot section. This
portion of the mountain is void of every trace of vegetation,
it is marked by ruined geyser mounds, smeared
with sticky clay of many colors, punctured with tiny
fumaroles whence issue wavering wands of steam, while
in many places rivulets of hot water break through the
pasty crust. The area of real activity is about 3,000
feet by 1,800 feet. The place is strewn with fragments
of geyserite and bits of wood, straw and metal,
thinly encrusted with the mineral deposit from the
springs. Cast a stick, a straw or a bit of paper where
the spray will fall on it and in a day it will have become
petrified and cemented to the rock beneath. The entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
substratum is intensely heated, the ground is in a
constant tremor which often accelerates to a gentle
quake. Far down below these hissing, silicious tubes
there is unknown latent heat. For ages the thermal
capacity of this place has been sufficient to eject untold
millions of tons of superheated water, at frequent intervals,
in large installments from these stupendous
safety valves.</p>

<p>We roamed over the section several times with our
attention always fixed on <i>Geysir</i> and ready at the slightest
warning to dash madly towards it should it condescend
to favor us with a manifestation of its power.
In the meantime we plugged the tube of a little geyser
with turf and then stood aside to listen to the heavy
gurgle of reproach which rattled in its throat and to
witness the vomiting of boiling water to a height of
twenty-five feet. As soon as it got relief we plugged
it up again and as often as we administered the turf
so often did it eject it. It was midnight and Mrs.
Russell had long since retired, but the weirdness of the
place held sleep aloof from my eyes. In company with
a German I wandered over the area again, stood on the
rim of <i>Geysir</i> to watch our shadows in its depths hoping
for the occasion to arise for us to chase those shadows
headlong up the mountain slope. We returned to the
little spouter and played like a couple of boys. As a
parting shot we decided to give it an extra amount of
turf and to ram it down the barrel with a pole. We
did this with so much success that we waited long for
the discharge but there was none. We had loaded it
too well. The tube of our gun was too strong to
burst, the wadding was packed too tightly for the
powder to blow it out. Silently we sat by it for an
hour when my companion said,—</p>

<p>“Geyser schlaft.”</p>

<p>To which I replied,—“Ich will schlafen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>The day after the following it burst out with a fine
jet of water at six in the morning and spouted without
interruption till nine when we rode away. As we passed
over the ridge we looked back and the last sight we had
of this place was the top of a column of water pouring
from this tube. The extra charge of turf was well
worth the trouble.</p>

<p>Morning came but <i>Geysir</i> had not erupted. Its surface
betrayed no signs of past disturbances and gave
no promise for the future. From the neighboring farms
we collected seventy pounds of bar soap which we cast
into the center of the basin, where it immediately sank.
We were told that during the day there would certainly
be an eruption. The soap is kept here expressly for
sale for this work. Ask an Icelander what the agency
of the soap is and he will reply,—</p>

<p>“I do not know, it always does it and does it thoroughly.”
I venture the following explanation. Recalling
that the accepted idea of the interior of a geyser
is that of a large chamber of heated rock nearly filled
with water and that below the water line there is a
tube which bends down then upward into a chamber
in the rock. The water becomes superheated. The
steam and other gases in the dome of the chamber are
under terrific pressure on account of the great heat and
the weight of the column of water above, (if one thinks
of the geyser tube connecting the underground basin
with the surface as the letter J). When the pressure
in the dome over the water becomes greater than the
downward force of the water in the long arm of the
tube then there is an upward movement through the
tube. The expanding steam throws out some of the
water. This reduces the pressure on the superheated
water in the basin and some of the water bursts into
steam to continue the action. This process goes on
till basin, tube, underground chamber and connecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
tubes are empty. Distant and cooler underground
waters now rush in freely to refill the system and time
produces a repetition. It is easy to construct glass apparatus
in the laboratory to demonstrate this phenomenon.
But what of the soap? This substance is composed
of materials which quickly break down into hydrocarbon
gases and increase the pressure in the chamber,
just like oil spurted into the superheater of a water gas
machine.</p>

<p>Many of the boiling springs, spurting jets and
fumaroles are alike in this locality but three of them
deserve special notice.</p>

<p><i>Blesi</i>, Blaze, as the white stripe in a horse’s face, is a
charming grotto. It is a double basin connected with
a tunnel just beneath a narrow bridge near the surface.
These basins are about thirty feet deep. One is eighteen
by twelve and the other thirty by twenty feet in the
longest and shortest diameters respectively. The water
is wonderfully transparent and the white silicious lining
of the grottoes reflects from the sky the delicate shade
of blue transforming it into a huge cavity of lapis lazuli.
<i>Blesi</i> is the traveler’s friend. It provides hot water
for the bath, cooks his food, warms his couch through
the medium of the hot water bag and prepares his
coffee. Many a leg of mutton, many a brace of birds
and innumerable are the eggs that have been faithfully
prepared with its friendly heat. It is an easy method
of cooking. Fill a pail with eggs and submerge it till
they are soft, medium or hard, the time required is
the same as in the kitchen. Place the meat in a cloth
bag and do the same. Dip up the water and pour it
upon the freshly ground berries, lo! the coffee is prepared
and your meal is ready. This spring never erupts
but pours out a steady stream which flows down the
slope to join the runway from <i>Geysir</i>.</p>

<p><i>Strokr</i> is another hot spring with a tube ten feet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
diameter and over forty feet deep. In former days it
was most accommodating and would always give an
exhibition of its powers if a couple of bushels of turf
were thrown into the tube. The response came in
from five to forty minutes. It usually threw out the
turf and ejected a column of water upwards of a hundred
feet. Again and again would it hurl out the
boiling water until its underground system was exhausted.
Some years since a party of gentlemen, French
I believe, desirous of obtaining an extra high spout
threw many stones into the tube on top of the turf.
The geyser siphon was doubtless broken or at least fractured
so that superheated steam can not be stored, for
<i>Strokr</i> spouts no more. It boils furiously all the time
with dense clouds of steam and the water rises and falls
in the tube in the most violent manner. In looking
into the tube one is impressed with the idea that there
are safer places, as it seems if <i>Strokr</i> were about to
mount into the sky to challenge <i>Geysir</i> which has so
long held the palm.</p>

<p><i>Geysir</i> is the main attraction. The first mention of
this phenomenon in literature is in the History of Norway
written by <i>Saxo Gramaticus</i>, who lived between
1150 and 1206, so that it has been active for over seven
centuries. It has built for itself a mound of geyserite
many feet above the level of the plain and has the appearance
of an inverted oyster shell in its series of terraces.
This mound increases with each eruption by the
addition of a film of salts held in solution in the boiling
water. The spring is in the form of a saucer with
the inward sloping side at an angle of thirty degrees.
The diameter of this saucer is nearly seventy feet and
the saucer is a true circle. Within a saucer there is a depression
at the bottom, a ring to hold the cup. Within
the center of <i>Geysir’s</i> saucer there is an opening, ten
feet in diameter, which extends straight down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the depth of eighty-four feet. Beyond this the
plumb will not go. Whether there are deeper ramifications
of tubes or not is a matter of conjecture
unless the explanation of geyser action above offered
is correct. Again, the shape of <i>Geysir</i> is that
of a funnel, i. e. a tube running downward from a
flaring reservoir at the top. During the irregular
periods between the eruptions, the water wells upwards
in the center and overflows the rim of the basin through
a foot square opening in the side. This opening has
been shaped by the farmer of <i>Haukadalr</i> to confine
the escaping hot water to one channel. The water is
heavily charged with minerals in solution. An English
analysis of a gallon of the water yielded the following:—</p>

<p>During eruptions large volumes of carbon dioxid and
some hydrogen sulfid and a little free hydrogen are
emitted. In 1909 my maximum recording thermometer
was lowered to a depth of eighty feet and the
temperature was 110C., or 230 degrees on the Fahrenheit
scale.</p>

<p>Words convey but a meager idea of the magnificence
of this geyser during eruption, or the awe with which
it inspires the witness of its extraordinary display of
power. It was six-thirty in the evening, eight hours after
we had administered the emetic of soap. Not a cloud
dimmed the blueness of the sky and no air was stirring.
The glaciers of <i>Láng Jökull</i>, the long ice-covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
mountain, loomed beyond the plain of the <i>Hvitá</i>, White-River,
the dome of <i>Hekla</i>, Hooded, had momentarily
lost its cloud mantle, all the little geysers and fumaroles
were boiling merrily and steaming furiously. Even
quiet <i>Blesi</i> was sending up showers of carbon dioxid
bubbles. The signs were favorable for an exhibition
and the people were gathered close about the Inn in
expectation. What the condition of the air has to do
with the eruption, I do not suggest. Icelanders familiar
with <i>Geysir</i> state that “when the wind is from
the north there is never an eruption.” I can only add
that during our first eighteen hours at this place we had
a strong wind from the north and no eruption.</p>

<p>We were at supper. The ground trembled, the
building vibrated and a dull rumbling reached the
ears.</p>

<p>“<i>Geysir! Geysir!</i>” rose the cry from within and
without the building. The supper was never finished.
Johannes, who had been watching for these first signs
ever since we had administered the emetic, met us as
we sprang to the doorway. Everyone rushed to the
elevation across from <i>Geysir’s</i> runway. Again the rumble,
heavier than before. The water is agitated in the
basin, it boils up suddenly, subsides, the earth beneath
our feet trembles and a mass of steaming water rises
in the center of the basin to an elevation of fifteen feet
and overflows the rim with a noisy splash. Then all
is quiet. Is this what we had travelled forty miles out
of our way to see? Truly a great fuss for nothing.
Is this the wonderful <i>Geysir</i> whose manifestation of
power had caused the devout Henderson to fall upon
his knees and to pour out his “soul in solemn adoration
of the Almighty Author of nature, ‘who looketh on the
earth, and it trembled; who toucheth the hills, and they
smoke?’” Does <i>Geysir</i> demand more tribute in soap?
A few moments of quiet expectation followed. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
without further warning, a column of superheated water,
ten feet in diameter, shot like a rocket into the air
to the height of one hundred and twenty-five feet and
the abysmal forces maintained that column for nine
minutes. What a flood of water poured down the sloping
cone! What a fountain! Mark Twain said that
they “have real fountains in Europe but in America
they only leak.” What would he have said could he
have witnessed this display? The roar of falling water
filled the air to the exclusion of all voices and flowed
in hissing cascades down the slope, into the ravine and
across the meadow to the river. The sheep fled before
the advancing column of steam and from a distance
gazed with a foolish stare at a spectacle that they
had often witnessed. Volume upon volume of steam,
like the cauliflower-shaped clouds of active Vesuvius,
belched into the air expanding under the reduced pressure
and filled the air to the shutting out of the sun.
Fountains of foam well over the brink. Explosion
follows explosion and still that lofty tower of boiling
water stands erect and masses of water fall to earth
with a terrific crash. The column wavers, totters, falls.
The eruption is over, the steam clouds lift and we rush
up the dripping slope of geyserite, step over the rim
into the hot basin and peer down into these depths
whence came those rivers of water. The heat penetrates
the thick soles of the riding boots but we walk
to the edge of the tube and gaze down into the sizzling
throat of the monster. A mass of foam is over the
bottom, eighty feet below. It rises, we watch its ascent
of the tube with the pace of a fly up a wall. It reaches
the junction of the tube with the bottom of the basin
and we photograph it, just a mass of foam with ascending
steam. It wells over into the basin and we retreat.
Soon the basin is full and overflows normally
and the only evidence of the change that has taken
place is the dripping cone and the steam rising from
the brook as it rushes to cool itself in the icy river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>During the eruption I caught a glimpse of a dark
object in the steam which fell with a thud upon the
grass. After the display and the basin had filled I
sought that spot and found a mass of geyserite twelve
inches square and two inches thick. It was still hot.
It is perforated with steam tubes in every direction. I
stowed it in the packing case and it is now in the
Science Museum at Springfield, Mass.</p>

<p>At nine thirty that evening we were again treated to
the same phenomenon by <i>Geysir</i> and again at six the
following morning. Three magnificent ejections at a
cost of only ten dollars worth of soap. It was worth
much more. The final display was the finest of the
three and lasted ten minutes. We were dressing when
the cry of “<i>Geysir!</i>” again reached the Inn. What
did it matter that the toilet was not finished! Travellers
from Denmark, Sweden, Norway, America, Germany
and distant parts of Iceland were there to see
<i>Geysir</i> spout and not to be fastidious about coiffure and
raiment. We all assembled hastily at the brink, each
unconscious of the others’ presence until the display
was over. Then! What a startled and confused company!
Several were clad only in sleeping costumes,
some had put on one stocking and were holding a shoe
and a stocking in the hand, some dragged a skirt by the
band and still others trailed their pantaloons by the
suspenders. One man held his shirt by the sleeve and
had one leg in his trousers while the other was innocent
of all clothing. There were Icelandic matrons and
maidens barefooted, some with a skirt wrapped around
them and others with a sheet. Rows of discarded garments
marked the way from the Inn to the mound and
during the retreat, which was a blushing and precipitous
one, each caught from the grass the clothes that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
fallen during the advance. Ludicrous describes it well,
but every one was happy and during the breakfast
which followed the confusion was forgotten.</p>

<p>Standing upon the rim of the great basin and gazing
at the azure surface the peacefulness of the scene belies
the turbulence of the hour before. In the distance
<i>Láng Jökull</i> glistens in the brilliant sunshine. Yonder,
across the <i>Hvitá</i>, cloud-capped and snowy-mantled
<i>Hekla</i> rises grand and lonely above its lava-wasted
plain. Around us the numerous springs and fumaroles
emit their endless columns of vapor and <i>Strokr</i> moans
and groans. The little geyser which we packed with
turf two nights ago has been spouting without interruption
for two hours. What a contrast! Arctic ice and
Plutonic fire battling for supremacy as they have done
for ages in this land of strange confusion,—and still
the conflict wages. Loth are we to turn from this
manifestation of power and imposing grandeur of
<i>Geysir</i>, even in his hours of rest, but <i>Gullfoss</i> lies beyond
the <i>Túngufljót</i>, the <i>Thjorsá</i> and the <i>Ölfusá</i> must
be forded, <i>Hekla</i> challenges from the midst of his
desolation, the peaceful pastoral plains of the south are
calling, the weird and frightful solfataras of <i>Krisuvik</i>
entice,—and we must saddle and away.</p>

<p class="dropcap">It requires an effort of the will to leave <i>Geysir</i>.
There is a fascination in this heated area that is
like the sirens in Ulysses’ tale. We mounted in the
wind-driven spray of the little geyser and turned
towards the <i>Túngufljót</i>, several tributaries of which
had to be forded. The quicksands are frequent in these
streams and must be avoided. Many ponies have
foundered in them and brought their riders to grief.
The grass plains are freely sprinkled with flowers and
as we left the geyser region behind, the cottongrass,
<i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i>, reappeared. This plant
waves its white tassel in all the Icelandic meadows,
sometimes so abundantly as to make the distant area
appear like a patch of snow. It is entirely absent in
soil that is under the influence of any of the hot springs.
The meadows through which we passed are excellent
grass lands and the hay harvest was in progress. The
men were swinging the short scythe, the women raking
and the boys and ponies carrying the bundles of hay to
the stacks.</p>

<p><i>Gullfoss</i>, Golden-Fall, is distant ten miles from
<i>Geysir</i>. The trail leads over a very boggy country, especially
after the crossing of the <i>Túngufljót</i>. A good
bridge now spans the main river. It was a large and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
merry cavalcade that spread out upon the rising ground
in the bog above the river. All the guests at <i>Geysir</i>,
satisfied with having seen the eruptions, were bent upon
improving the opportunity to visit the famous falls.
The section of bog, to which we have referred, is on
an upland slope and it is filled with ruts, hummocks
and moss sponges. The hummocks are crowned with
several species of <i>Juncus</i>, the cotton-grass points out
the moss sponges and the slimy algae locate the wettest
spaces. The older ponies with eyes and nose alert always
avoid the sloughs. If there is evidence of the
recent passage of a pony, another will confidently follow.
It is interesting to watch these little fellows sniffing
the ground and testing it with the fore feet when no
foot marks point a sure way. Leave the rein loose
upon the neck, curb your impatience and trust the pony
to keep out of a bog; urge him to take a short cut or
to increase his chosen pace, and horse and rider are sure
to become stuck in the bog, a bad predicament. Some
English writers describe this passage as most difficult
and dangerous. Take a local guide from <i>Haukadalr</i>
and let no traveller who reaches <i>Geysir</i> forbear a visit
to <i>Gullfoss</i> on account of the bog. The passage is not
so very bad and the falls are worth much more than
the effort.</p>

<p>At the summit of the hill, across the muddy area,
we paused to view the scene below. The <i>Túngufljót</i>
drains the southern slopes of <i>Láng Jökull</i>, its three
great arms thrust downward through the alluvial plains,
a mighty trident of hydraulic power, forced by the melting
glaciers during the continuous shine of the summer
sun. It is a delightful view,—the luxuriant green below
crossed by the silver threads of the rivers, the
whiteness of the glaciers across the valley and the steam
clouds hovering over the heated area.</p>

<p>We turned to the north where the thunders of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
falls boomed from beyond the cliffs and the mists glistened
high in the air. No falls, not even the river is
visible, they are embedded in the canyon a mile beyond.
The crashing roar of the water increased and turning
an angle of the cliffs the steeds paused upon the brink
of the <i>Hvitá</i> canyon. The full glory of the falls burst
upon us radiant in its sheaf of rainbows. Leaving the
ponies to graze upon the brink, we descended the crumbling
wall to the level of the triangular area within the
canyon. This grassy, mist-washed mass of rock is on
a level with the top of the lower falls, the real plunge
of the <i>Hvitá</i> into the lava abyss. As far as the mass
of water is concerned this fall is the largest, not only
in Iceland but in all Europe. Its rival, the <i>Dettifoss</i>,
Drop-Falls, has a deeper canyon, a higher fall but there
is not so great a mass of water. This waterfall is on
the <i>Jökulsá</i>, Ice-Mountain-River, in the northeast of
Iceland. The canyon of the <i>Hvitá</i> is V-shaped, about
fifty feet wide at the top and not more than a dozen
feet at the bottom. Most of the waterfalls in Iceland
are formed, like the <i>Öxerá</i>, by a river falling into a
<i>Gjá</i>, rift, from the side of the canyon. In the case of
the <i>Gullfoss</i> the water falls into the end of the canyon,
for this great rift begins at the falls. Just above the
main falls the water rushes over a series of ledges,
columnar basalt bluffs, fifteen hundred feet wide and
fifty feet high. The space between these falls and
the main plunge is short. Here the water runs wide
and deep with a troubled surface, fretted with foam
and impatient for the approaching plunge into the unfathomed
depth.</p>

<p>A huge mass of rock divides the main falls at the
top with about one hundred feet in width of water on
each side. It is from this point that H. Rider Haggard
in <i>Eric Brighteyes</i> causes the hero to descend into the
canyon of the <i>Hvitá</i> to swim to the lower end in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to win the hand of Gudruðr, the Fair. Of all the
strange and imaginative tales which this writer has
related this is the most improbable. The water upon
the brink of the two arms of the falls is eighty feet
deep and the plunge into the canyon is not less than two
hundred. What a water power and no syndicate to
control it!</p>

<p>The true falls can not be photographed. The triangular
plot upon which we have been standing is within
the canyon and the walls rise above us to the height of
about two hundred feet. Above us the palisaded buttresses,
drenched with spray, glisten in the morning sun
and hanging over the chasm frown upon the river below
as if threatening to prevent its escape. The imprisoned
waters boil and foam in their mad contention with the
walls ragingly impatient of their restriction, anxious
to escape to the rural calmness of the southern plains.
So mighty is the mass of water, so narrow are the depths
into which it hurls itself that one must believe that subterranean
passages exist or the lava rift would fill and
quickly choke itself to overflowing. It is possible that
these hidden rifts, results of earthquakes, supply the
water for the hot springs far away. Perhaps the ramifications
of great <i>Geysir’s</i> underground system reach
even to the foot of this canyon, even as one end of the
drinking horn, out of which <i>Thor</i> drank in the halls of
<i>Utgard-Loki</i>, was placed in the sea, so that <i>Thor</i> lost
his wager by being unable to empty the horn at a
single draught.</p>

<p>Grim, grand and glorious is the Foss, surpassing
Niagara in scenic environment. Under suitable conditions
Niagara has its well-known rainbow, but <i>Gullfoss</i>
has several of them arching the waters one above the
other in the dense volume of spray that is hurled two
hundred and fifty feet above the surface of the stream.
If the fabled pot of gold at the foot of the rainbow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
arch is to be obtained anywhere, it must be sought for
in this place, for within the walls of the upper canyon
the rainbows end. One may pass through them and even
stand at the springing of the prismatic arch if he is
willing to take the drenching of the down-pouring floods
of spray, like sheets of water in a New England thunder
storm. Grand as is the <i>Gullfoss</i>, its setting is even
more impressive. Above the plain <i>Láng Jökull</i>
stretches forty miles across the horizon, lifting its
unexplored surface of adamantine ice high in air, a
perpetual challenge to him who would search the unknown.
At its base and near at hand <i>Hvitávatn</i>, White-River-Lake,
the source of the river, carries a fleet of
icebergs upon its sun-lit surface. In the perpetual sunlight
of Iceland’s summer months this vast icefield discharges
constant floods down its cliffs. Hence the <i>Hvitá</i>
starts upon its turbulent course to the sea a full-grown
river laden with glacial clay. Towards the east the
peaks of <i>Kerlingafjáll</i>, Old-Woman-Peaks, arrest the
eye, around whose skirts hot springs are scattered sending
up a mass of vapor like incense to the heroic gods
of Scandinavian mythology.</p>

<p>The thunders of <i>Gullfoss</i> diminished as we followed
the brink of its canyon southward and descended into
the stony waste of <i>Biskuptúngur</i>, Bishop’s-Tongue, a
tongue-shaped mass of fertile land in the valley of the
<i>Túngufljót</i> formerly belonging to a bishop. Here the
foaming of its silt-laden stream was the only evidence
of the recent travail of the <i>Hvitá</i>. Of the twenty travellers
in the party from <i>Geysir</i> all had returned except
one, a German who stayed with us till we reached
<i>Skipholt</i>, Ship-Ridge. On the way he told us of an
amusing experience he had had with the Icelandic pony.
During the first hour of his ride he wished to stop and
repeatedly shouted “Whoa!” The pony only went
the faster and finally ran away with him. He stated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
that he had ridden horseback in many lands and no matter
what language was spoken this was the first country
where “whoa!” did not mean “stop.” <i>Hót</i> or <i>hoa</i> is
the Icelandic word at which a pony starts quickly into
a trot or gallop and the sound so much resembles
“whoa” that the pony was doing his best to be obedient.</p>

<p>About noon we regained the trail that leads from
<i>Geysir</i> across the <i>Hvitá</i> towards <i>Hekla</i>. And again we
found pleasure in the earlier visit of the King, for a
good bridge has been constructed across the <i>Hvitá</i> at
this place. This is one of the worst of the Icelandic
rivers to ford and many people have been drowned in
the attempt. A few miles through a delightful country
brought us to <i>Skipholt</i> which we found to be a model
farm. It is one of the best in Iceland. During the
visit of the King in 1907 he was so well pleased with
the conditions at this farm that he presented the owner
with a medal in the form of a cross for the excellence
of his work and the skill he had displayed in the construction
of the buildings and in the management of
his flocks and herds. It was the wish of the King that
it might prove an incentive to the neighboring farmers
to do their best to imitate their more prosperous neighbor.</p>

<p>It was Sunday and no work was in progress. We
left the ponies in the lane and went up to the house
where we received a cordial welcome and the farmer’s
wife set before us an excellent dinner. With a mixture
of English, German and French we conversed for an
hour over the dinner with our German companion who
proved to be a professor at Berlin but spoke no English.
The landlady beamed upon us, all the while conscious
of our difficulties and had it not been for the
Icelandic reserve I have no doubt that she would have
proved a good interpreter. It was not till later that
we discovered that many of these people can speak several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
languages. The biscuit, pastry, griddlecakes, mutton
and coffee were excellent as well as the butter, cheese
and milk and it did seem, by other standards, as if
we had eaten more than the value of twenty-five cents
each, which was the charge.</p>

<p>At <i>Skipholt</i> there is an excellent set of buildings
mostly made of wood, the turf walls are in prime repair,
the fields free from stones and smooth, smoothness
being a rare condition of Icelandic mowing fields, the
flocks are large and the cattle numerous. It is the only
farm in the country where I have seen running water
supplied to the stables. I must add that there are other
farms in the north which the King did not visit that
are as prosperous as <i>Skipholt</i>. This was the best one
that he visited. If he had gone to <i>Skútustaðir</i>, <i>Kalmungstúnga</i>
or <i>Miklibaer</i> he would also have found
praiseworthy conditions and no doubt would have rewarded,
at least with a word of praise, the industrious
farmers at these steads.</p>

<p>Bidding the <i>bondé</i> and the good-wife at <i>Skipholt</i>
good bye and receiving in return their hearty <i>góðr á daginn</i>
we turned towards <i>Hruni</i>. Our German companion
continued southward to <i>Skálholt</i> and we left the
road to climb the series of ridges between the valleys
of the <i>Hvitá</i> and the <i>Laxá</i>, Salmon-River. The ponies
picked their way over ridge after ridge of lava crags
with alternate ascent and descent. In some places the
declivities were so steep that it was difficult to retain our
seat in the pommelless saddles. The surcingles were old
and cracked and we put little trust in them. However,
they held, else we would have experienced a very undignified
descent. I have seen hundreds of saddles and
bridles in Iceland and never have I seen a new one. I
often wondered if they were ever new. It is remarkable
that they seldom break. As we climbed the last ridge
we met a barebacked rider, a tall, sun-browned shepherd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
carrying a lost lamb in his bosom with its head
protruding above the rider’s arm and the well known
words of Elizabeth Clephane’s hymn came to our
lips,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“But all thro’ the mountains thunder riven</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And up from the rocky steep,</div>
<div class="verse">There rose a cry to the gate of heaven,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">‘Rejoice! I have found my sheep.’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was five in the evening when we mounted the last
ridge and looked down upon <i>Hruni</i>. It was one of the
fairest sights I have ever witnessed,—the basin-shaped
valley of verdure surrounded by lofty ridges, the thousand
sheep scattered upon the hillsides and through the
meadow, the group of houses which constitute the farm
buildings, and the little church across the yard, the
steam rising from some hot springs near the dwellings,
the hundreds of haycocks waiting for the morrow to
be taken to the stacks, the songs of the maidens driving
the cows home from the pasture,—a picture of prosperity
and of peace. Surely this is not Iceland or else the
name is a misnomer.</p>

<p>It cost us an hour to pick our way across the hassocky
bog, luxuriant with rushes, sedges, and cotton-grass. No
frog croaks in the Iceland marshes and no reptile ever
glides through the sheltering grass, they are unknown.
It seemed as if we might reach the house in ten minutes
but it took an hour. We learned that to approach
an Icelandic farmhouse it is usually necessary to ride
around it in a wide detour. Bogs, streams, fences or
hot areas seem ever to lie between the house and the
place where the traveller first sees it. During our circuit
we saw a flaxen haired, barefooted lad seated upon
a hummock with a book and a bundle of plants by his
side. A dog was with him and two others watched the
sheep from distant points, reclining with noses between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
their feet with eyes alert for any change in the direction
of the feeding sheep. If a group of them started
towards the mowing land the dog spoke once or twice
and if the sheep did not turn he trotted nearer and
spoke again in a more determined tone. The sheep
obeyed and the dog returned to his vantage point. I
dismounted when the boy saluted us and shook hands
with him and returned the Icelandic salutation. I examined
the handful of flowers and noticed that some
of them were partially dissected. Reaching for the
worn and faded book I discovered that it was a Manual
of the Icelandic Flora and that it was written entirely
in Latin. A lad of twelve or thirteen years of age; his
task, the keeping of a thousand sheep with no fences
beyond the immediate farm enclosure; his recreation,
the study of botany through the medium of Latin. Of
such boys are the Icelandic scholars made, not through
the medium of costly buildings, fine equipment, luxurious
homes, indulgent parents, theaters, parties and secret
societies, but through the wiser agencies of paternal
love that sternly upholds usefulness, interest in study
for the love of knowledge. Though barefoot and clad
in vaðmal, the Icelandic lad will obtain an education
that surpasses the products of the endowed institutions
of other lands.</p>

<p>At six in the afternoon we were welcomed in the
guest room of the pastor’s home. Kjartan Helgason,
farmer and minister, labors six days upon his large farm
and on the seventh preaches in two different churches,
riding several miles to meet his distant parishioners. He
came soon after our arrival and welcomed us with a
cordial, honest welcome. That Icelandic welcome! It
comes from the heart and the handshake conveys more
than words can express. Hospitality was a sacred word
in ancient Scandinavia and though but a filmy covering
for hypocrisy in many more favored lands, in Iceland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the essence is maintained. Welcome! How often we
say it and hear it and do not know the meaning. We
welcome some long absent loved one. Is it the same
when we welcome a neighbor or a frequent visitor?
What about the welcome accorded to a total stranger
who brings us nothing but extra work, who calls us
from our necessary task, who eats our choicest viands,
who uses our guest chamber, consumes our time with
questions that pry into our very secrets? Would you
know the meaning of this ancient word you must see it
exemplified as a dependent stranger in a strange land.
<i>Vel-kominn</i>, well-come, it is good that you have come.
Unless this meaning rings in the sound and bristles
in our every act it is better that we drop from our
vocabulary this word which we have borrowed from an
ancient race. Not alone at <i>Hruni</i> did we hear and feel
<i>Vel-kominn</i> but in every household from the humblest
peasant on the borders of the desert to the homes of
the highest in the land, even the professors at the
University, the venerable poet of the north and the
Prime Minister in his mansion.</p>

<p>The Icelandic Sunday ends at six in the afternoon.
When we came from the house after supper we were
astonished to see the farm maids going to the fields
with their ropes and rakes, the mowers sharpening their
scythes and the general bustle of a work day. Inquiry
of the pastor revealed to us the custom. The method
of sharpening the scythe is unique. The Icelandic boy
does not have to turn the stone while a strong man
leans his weight upon the scythe and slides it back and
forth across the revolving stone. As a boy I always regarded
the turning of the stone as a man’s job and I
still think so. Many disagreeable tasks on the farm are
given to the boy just because he is a boy. In Iceland
the blade is placed on a flat piece of steel and the edge
slips under a presser-foot like that on a sewing machine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
A rod of steel with a square end and a half inch in
diameter is placed perpendicularly upon the blade between
the claws of the presser-foot and is struck a
smart blow with a hammer. The blade is slowly advanced
under the repeated blows. The blade is thus
hammered into an edge rather than ground. I noticed
the custom throughout the country. At <i>Hruni</i> there
was a machine worked with a treadle and cam that
did the pounding while the operator slowly advanced
the blade. Two days later I met a gentleman from
Worcester, Massachusetts, to whom I mentioned this
method. He had not seen it and was doubtful of the
accuracy of my observations. While we were discussing
it there came from the back of the buildings the sharp
clink-clink-clink of the steel and he was soon convinced
by observation that I was not joking. The whetstone
is used in the same way as with the American farmer.
It was interesting to note that all the scythestones in the
country were made in New Hampshire, U. S. A.
These stones are shipped to Denmark, resold by the
Danish merchant and shipped to Iceland; the Icelandic
trader sells them to the farmer. The farmer then pays
a price that is just half of what the New England farmer
pays for the same stone. It is evident that the scythestone
industry does not need any tariff protection.</p>

<p>In front of the house an excellent patch of potatoes
was in full bloom unravished by the Colorado beetle.
A flowering rose bush climbed the house-wall by the
door, which was flanked by several species of the old-fashioned
flowers that bloom so persistently around the
dilapidated dwellings of New England’s abandoned
farms. A herd of cows were yielding their milk within
a turf enclosure at one end of the house and the
newly painted church across the lane added to the peacefulness
and thriftiness of the scene.</p>

<p>The hot spring on the farm furnishes the heat for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the cooking and the hot clay is used for baking. Rye
bread is baked by digging a hole in the clay and inserting
a stone jar. This bread reminded us strongly of the
fine products of the old brick ovens of our grandmothers.
In the evening, pastor Helgason invited us into
his study and in a mixture of Icelandic, English and
Latin we conversed till midnight. This library contains
many volumes of choice literature, theological works,
and history. He also showed us a large herbarium in
which the plants were mounted accordingly to Linnaeus
and named. We then learned more about the favorite
occupation of the lad who tends the sheep and studies
botany at the same time. Through the labor of father
and son several new species of plants have been added
to the flora of the country, some of them unknown elsewhere.
It was my pleasure on my return to send to
these botanists a copy of the last edition of <i>Gray’s
Manual</i> and I count among my choicest letters from
Iceland a reply from Kjartan Helgason to which was
attached a rare and beautiful gentian, <i>Gentiana campestris,
L. var. Íslandica</i>.</p>

<p>The bedrooms to which we were assigned were models
of neatness and comfort. The eiderdown coverlets,
everpresent, were encased in dainty slips and the sheets
were artistically embroidered. Embroidery is a pastime
on the farms and the industry of girls as well as
the women has produced many beautiful pieces that
would be given places of honor in the American guest
room. Spinning, weaving, knitting are thriving arts
in Icelandic homes. The mill and dry goods stores
have not driven these delightful occupations from the
homes. Delightful? Yes. When labor is performed
because of the joy it affords the laborer, then the product
is not only useful but it becomes a work of art.
William Morris said, “Art is the expression of a man’s
joy in his work.” These Icelandic works of art are made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
for the use of generations. They are not items of common
occurrence in the dry goods store, purchased to-day,
worn out to-morrow or thrown aside because your
neighbor has found a different pattern. Being individual
work, no two are alike. Each works into the fabric
her own design and with the stitches go thought, care,
accuracy and the result is <i>art</i>. No better attraction
could be placed in the show window of our linen merchants
than some of these tastefully embroidered pillowslips,
table covers or other fancy work.</p>

<p>The quality of the hospitality in these Icelandic
homes is such as to make the stranger feel as if he were
at home and it is all done so quietly and without any
display. It is simply natural. Every where there is
perfect safety, on the long trail, in the village or on
the lonely farm. All one has he may leave exposed in
the sheds for days without fear of its being disturbed.
Honesty is bred in the race. It is refreshing to have no
use for locks and to know that one can not lose anything
unless he deliberately casts it into a rift. Whatever
one leaves behind him will be forwarded and as
Ólafur once said,—</p>

<p>“It is a matter of great pride if an Icelander finds
anything to be able to return it to the owner and he
will make every effort to do this.”</p>

<p>The people deal honestly with each other and with the
stranger. In former days it was customary to entertain
the traveller over night and accept no payment. It is not
so now and it is better as it is. Supplies must be carried
many days over mountains, across the rivers and always
on the backs of the ponies so that they are expensive.
The Icelanders are not rich, though many
of them are quite comfortably situated, as is the farmer
at <i>Hruni</i>. Still, it is not right to take of their substance
simply because they feel it in their hearts to give it.
In spite of the payment for the lodging and the food,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the traveller will always depart knowing that he has
received kindness, comfort and thoughtfulness for
which he can not pay.</p>

<p>The people are quiet in demeanor, often reserved before
strangers, but they are not morose and despondent
as some writers have stated. They thoroughly enjoy
a good time, laugh and joke with the wittiest of people,
are fond of singing and have excellent voices. The tone
of the voice is soft, refined and pleasant to the ear.
There are no dialects. They speak as did their ancestors
of twelve centuries ago and the accounts of these
people in their ancient Sagas in the main are true to
day. Bad manners in children I have never seen: in
politeness they are models of a high order. They are
the children we have read about, those “that are seen
and not heard.” It is worth a cake of chocolate at
any time just to see the face of the child light up and
have him shyly present his hand to the giver in genuine
gratitude. They are affectionate, obedient and
watchful for the welfare of the parents in their childish
way. Often have I seen a girl of ten or twelve wait
upon the table, while the remainder of the family were
eating, quietly attending to all the duties at the right
time without a word of direction and doing it as well
as a maid trained in the service.</p>

<p>Outside of <i>Reykjavik</i>, throughout the country the
women do not sit down to eat with the men unless a
woman is the guest. In all the homes where we stayed,
we never had the hostess sit at the table with us but
once, but the men often ate with us. This is an ancient
custom of the race. When the meal is over the guest
rises and shakes hands with the host or hostess and says
“thanks for the meal” and the response is, “may it do
you good.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Each day in Iceland brings new scenes. Each
morning we found ourselves asking,—“What
will be the excitement to-day?” The surprises
of the landscape are innumerable. Though
we were somewhat accustomed to the wild and strange
scenery, each ascent of a ridge, each turning of a mountain
angle presented surprising views. This is one of
the charms of travel on horseback through a roadless
country. The variety of scenes that unfold before the
eye is as rich as the changes in New England weather.
Day after day in the saddle does not produce monotony,
the unexpected lures the traveller onward and when
supper is over and he sits down upon some commanding
hillside of the farm to record the events of the day he
is prompted to write,—“This has been the best day of
all.”</p>

<p>We turned southward from <i>Hruni</i>, forded the <i>Laxá</i>
and climbed the sheep-pastured ridges that make a
gridiron of the territory between the <i>Laxá</i> and the
<i>Thjórsá</i>, Bull-River. The farms are widely scattered
but they have every appearance of rural prosperity.
The grazing lands are extensive, the grass abundant
and such masses of flowers in bloom as we trampled
during these ten miles I have never seen beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
influence of cultivation. These pastures are rich in
nutritious grass and thousands of sheep and many
ponies and cows are grazing on the hillsides. From
these slopes we look down upon the busy haying scenes
in the <i>tún</i>, strings of ponies laden with hay, a bundle
on each side, guided by a child from field to haystack,
maidens with rakes turning the fragrant grass, men
and women swinging scythes to a merry tune which all
are singing,—these are the elements of the Arcadian
picture.</p>

<p>At noon as we were working our way over a rough
and deeply rutted plot of meadow by the river, the
pack horses, in disputing the right of priority to one
of the ditches, rubbed their packing cases together so
vigorously that the metal hangers of one of the saddles
broke and it required an hour of time and all the string
and straps we could muster to enable us to proceed.
That night the farmer, in a little forge as primitive as
that of Tubal Cain, wrought new hangers. Nearly
every farmer has one of these little forges for repairing
his instruments. When the shop is not in use as a
blacksmith’s shop it is often used for smoking meat and
fish.</p>

<p>Soon after the accident we reached <i>Thjórsáholt</i>, Bull-Ridge.
Here we had our dinner upon the grass between
the house and the river, the weather being delightful.
The <i>Thjórsá</i> is broad and rapid and its waters
are icy cold. The farmer has a small boat and is
required by the government to act as ferryman. At the
bank of the river, packing cases, saddles and bridles
were all piled in a heap into the shaky and leaking boat.
We drove the ponies into the water to swim to the other
side. The two pack horses fully understood what was expected
of them and struck boldly into the current. Some
of the saddle ponies, after being swept down stream
a short distance, being chilled in the water, returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to the shore. We drove them in again and this time
they persevered. How I pitied them in the cold water!
The river is nearly a half mile wide, the current
runs so rapidly that it breaks into white water and it
sweeps the ponies down stream so rapidly that it seems
impossible for their strength to endure till they can
reach the opposite shore. In the midstream the water
swept over their backs so that only their noses and
ears were above the water. When the last ones were
half way over we followed in the boat, five of us in
number, and were swept rather than rowed in a diagonal
line down stream. When the ponies reached the
opposite bank they rolled in the sand, shook themselves
dry and cut capers as if they were yet colts wild and free
in their mountain pastures with no experience of curb
and strap. Each day revealed some new accomplishment
of these hardy beasts and this day my admiration surpassed
all previous experiences.</p>

<p>We were nearing <i>Hekla</i>, Hooded, so named from
the hood of cloud that nearly always caps the summit.
Evidences of its ten centuries and more of destruction
were all around us in deserts of ash and sand, ruined
farms, once the finest in the land, fragments and masses
of lava that had been hurled fifteen and twenty miles
in the many violent explosions from the craters of the
volcano and the changed water courses that had been
blocked by the flowing lava or choked by the drifting
sand. In single file the ponies waded through the fine
red, yellow and black sand and the dust kicked up by
the troup literally obscured the leaders. The wind
sifted the fine, gritty material through every needle-hole
in our clothing; it filled our hair, blinded the eyes and
produced miniature mud-cakes in the mouth. An hour
of this work satisfied us and we rejoiced as we edged
into a partly turfed section of the plain. Here the
sheep in scattered groups of three to fifteen marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the outskirts of the grazing land and turning towards
them we soon entered a long, narrow strip of excellent
grass land between two masses of the recent lava flow.
On approaching a farm we noted how the farmer had
constructed a series of wind-breaks of stone to keep the
sifting sand from encroaching too vigorously upon the
mowing land. There is very little good turf in this
section for fence building and the barbed wire has been
substituted. How out of place it is in Iceland! It is
ugly enough when hidden in the brush of a back pasture
in New England but when it stands out bare and
threatening above the green turf of an Icelandic
meadow and supplants the grass-grown walls of ancient
days, which add so much to the charm of the landscape,
it is incongruous. There are several farms in the
neighborhood of <i>Hekla</i> which are mere fragments of
their former size and to traverse the sand and lava
debris of this section is to realize a little of the terrible
havoc the volcano has spread around its base.</p>

<p>At four in the afternoon we reached <i>Galtalaekur</i>,
Boar-Brook, a poor little farm, just a remnant of grass
between the black lava and the ash heaps where once
a myriad acres of the choicest grazing lands in Iceland
supported a large population. The buildings are very
old and are strictly of the ancient type, consisting of
a series of six stone and turfed walled huts built side
by side. Each hut has a gable in front, no two of the
same height, but the roof is rounded down to the
ground at the back. The eaves of the adjacent roofs
coalesce and in the gutters the flowers attain an abnormal
development. There is no regularity as to the
size of the different sections of the house. Each portion
appears to have been added in times of increasing
prosperity as needed and built in proportions according
to the increment of need. They have been so long
constructed that age, even in an Icelandic house, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
showing itself and as the building grew from one end,
so now, from this same end is it crumbling. The family
are retreating from house to house and unless better
times come to this farm in the way of grass for cattle
and sheep, a few generations more will drive the family
to the last enclosure and then,—abandonment.</p>

<p>Let us enter the house. To do so we must stoop beneath
the lintel and step down into the passage which
has walls of turf, yellow and centuries dry, and an
earth floor packed and worn by the trampling of unnumbered
generations. There is no light in the passage
save what comes through the open door and as we turn
to our right, at right angles, blackness faces us. Groping
a little further a gleam of light locates a door at
the right which we open to enter the guest room. Here
there is also evidence of age. The room is well finished
with Norway spruce and innocent of paint. Age has
given to the wood a dark rich brown which no paint
can imitate or equal in richness of color. A triple window
lets in a flood of light for there are no such unsanitary
things as blinds and curtains. The windows
are after the Danish plan, split through the middle,
hinged at the sides and open outwards like American
blinds. This is an excellent innovation of recent years
and is often the only method of ventilation. Wood
houses admit an abundance of air through unnumbered
cracks and chinks in the joining, especially if built for
speculation, but walls of turf two to three feet thick are
proof against the slightest drafts. Miss Oswald in
1880 described the windows as being set solidly into the
walls with no way to open. She felt the oppression of
the foul air so much that she often broke out a light of
glass and paid for “the accident” in the morning with
an added apology. The influence of the medical officers
in their fight to decrease tuberculosis has produced
the desired change in window construction. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
never found a guest room where the windows did not
open as above described. The furniture of this room
consisted of a bed three feet wide and the customary
scantiness of length, a table and several chairs, numerous
boxes in which clothing and valuables are stored,
photographs in albums and in wire racks on the walls,
and an organ made in Brattleboro, Vermont. We
found these organs in every home save one during our
two summers of travelling among the farms, no matter
how humble the home.</p>

<p>The music most in evidence is sacred with numerous
selections from the German and Italian masters and
much of the minor lyrical music of the Icelandic school.
The people are fond of music and most of them are
fine singers, a few of them excellent. We will never
forget the quartett and the congregational singing in the
Cathedral at <i>Reykjavik</i> which we heard a year later.
There are numerous composers, the best known being
Sveinbjórn Sveinbjónsson, well known in the musical
circles of Europe, who now resides in Edinburgh, Scotland.
A large amount of the music has been composed
for the love-songs, idyls and pastoral hymns written by
the local poets. The themes of the song writers are
mostly pastoral, or, they are an appreciation of the
charming scenery which inspired such writers as Jonas
Hallgrimson and Matthias Jochumsson. The subtlety
of the Icelandic language does not permit of accurate
translation of the fine meaning into English. To
illustrate one of these appreciations combined with ardent
love of country, I have rendered into English, without
any attempt at alliteration, one stanza from Jonas
Hallgrimson,—</p>

<p>There are songs of the meadow and the sheep-tending,
of fishing and of the hay-harvest, of returning
spring and dying summer, of the happiness of home-life,
of sorrow and joy and love and the whole scale
of human emotions. In the midst of their poverty and
toil they are a cheerful and happy race, singing at their
occupations or writing songs in the saddle or at the
sheep-tending. The children are taught to appreciate
poetry and to write it and the result is that nearly every
one makes verses and out of the many attempts there
is much that is excellent. Much of the poetry is spontaneous
as in the <i>Saga</i> days. The <i>Sagas</i> are replete with
impromptu verses witty, ironical, boastful and descriptive.
Thus <i>Kari</i>, when <i>Skapti</i> accuses him of “sneaking
out of this atonement” after the famous trial of 1112
at the <i>Althing</i> for the burning of <i>Njal</i>, retorts, in
part,—</p>

<p>The great Icelandic poets have translated into the
Icelandic many of Shakespeare’s plays, the Iliad, <i>Odyssey</i>,
Paradise Lost and scores of the minor pieces of
English and American poetry as well as the masterpieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of German, French and Scandinavian literature.
When we learn that the rules for Icelandic poetry are
strict, that not only rhyme and rhythm but a complicated
alliteration must be incorporated in the verses,
we can understand what a task these translators have
had. There are many variations of the alliteration.
In the following is noted not only simple alliteration
but also that the <i>second hemistich begins with the
penultimate syllable of the first</i>. To illustrate note the

<p>The organ in this humble home suggested this digression.
Supper over, let us return to the farm. Down
by the stream there is a diminutive grist mill with hand-hewn
stones fifteen inches in diameter and turned by
a most primitive water wheel. The mill never stops.
The rye or barley, imported from Europe, is placed
in the hopper and ground whole. There is no differentiation
of the botanical parts as in America, where
the live stock get the nutritious portions and bread is
made out of the remainder because it is “white.” When
the meal bucket at the house is empty the maid goes
down to the brook, removes the flour, refills the hopper
and thus in rotation for years, or until the mill must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
be repaired. To appreciate this mill in all its simplicity
one must see it. The stones are placed on the upper
end of a vertical shaft. At the lower end of the shaft
there are simply two paddle blades attached to turn the
shaft under the pressure of the water. Simple, but
effective, always at work and producing nutritious flour
as long as the grains are added to the miniature hopper.</p>

<p>After an inspection of the mill, the same as found on
many farms, I visited the mowers. They were at
work with vigor, swinging the scythe with a powerful
stroke. This a mower does for about an hour when
he suddenly drops it in the swath, goes to the house for
a bowl of <i>Skyr</i>, curds, a cup of coffee or lounges on the
ground to smoke or take snuff with a companion in a similar
degree of exhaustion. After an hour of rest he returns
to his scythe and thus from early morning till midnight
does he labor during the haying season. There are
always some men and a few women mowing but one
can usually find two or three scythes deserted by their
users in the swath. I had an introduction to the
crooked, hand-blistering, ache-producing instrument of
America in my tender years which ripened into an acquaintance
of great familiarity, which, true to the
proverb, bred contempt. I examined this Icelandic
turf-parer not without misgivings as to what I could do
with so strange an implement. The scythe is twenty
inches long, straight and two and a half inches wide.
The blade is extremely thin and buckles and bends in
contact with the turf. The snath is the peculiar feature.
It is made like a rake handle and is six feet long, perfectly
straight and attached to the scythe at right angles.
The nebs are unlike; that for the right hand is
like ours and similarly placed, that for the left is a
straight strip about eighteen inches long and is placed
on the snath at right angles and just below the shoulder,
reaching down to the palm of the left hand. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the end of this strip is a cross piece to fit the palm much
like the end of a canoe paddle. The end of the long
snath protrudes over the left shoulder.</p>

<p>The men quit their work and watched me with a
quizzical expression as I picked up one of these abandoned
implements and swung it in the air once or twice
before venturing to set it into the grass, after the
fashion of a golfer before the drive. When the faces
of the mowers had broken into a smile, I knew that I
must try it and into the grass it went with the long
steady swing of the old habit. After a few strokes I
was cutting a wide clean swath and paring to the turf
so that the soil showed in the approved Icelandic style.
A middle aged man, who had been whetting his scythe,
struck in behind me close to my heels while the others
stood to watch the race. May I modestly state that
my New Hampshire training had not been in vain? I
had counted upon the Icelandic custom of slashing vigorously
for a distance of about two rods and then stopping
to use the whetstone. If I could hold out that
distance I knew that my honor would be safe. I did.
In his anxiety to mow me out he ran the whole length
of the blade into the tough turf and in pulling it out
lost several strokes, whereupon he decided to use the
stone and I dropped the scythe in the swath and stepped
aside. The onlookers burst into a roar of chaffing
at their companion and rushed to shake my hand and
pat me on the back. On smooth ground I afterwards
found that I could hold my own with them but on the
rough and hummocky land, which constitutes by far the
larger portion of the mowing, I could not cut over as
much ground as they. Seeing the thousands of adjacent
hummocks the size of a wash tub, covering acres of the
best mowing land and caused by the heaving of the turf
under the influence of the frost, I understood the reason
for the shape of the Icelandic scythe snath. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
kind of mowing the Icelander does not try to cut a
straight swath. He mounts a hummock, slashes the
grass and a part of the turf from the hummocks around
him, mounts the decapitated hummocks and deftly
shaves the sides and pares the hollows. There are no
stones in the mowing lands; scarcity of hay, the necessity
for getting all the short grass during the thousand
years of mowing has removed every trace of
lava fragments. Whenever we arrived at a farm I
worked an hour or more with the haymakers in order
to get acquainted with the people and study their
methods of work. After a half day in one field the
farmer told Johannes that I ought to stay in their
country, as I would make a good Icelander. This was
after I had had considerable experience with the scythe,
the fine-toothed rake and the <i>reipe</i>, rope, for binding
hay for transportation.</p>

<p>Evidently no one had occupied the guest room at
<i>Galtalaekur</i> for some time. When Icelanders arrive
at a farm to stay over night they, according to ancient
custom, go to the <i>baðstofa</i>, sitting and sleeping room,
where all the people sleep. In early days <i>baðstofa</i> signified
“bathroom,” but it has lost that meaning. Mrs.
Russell had retired early in anticipation of a hard day
on <i>Hekla</i>. When I came in from the hayfield she was
sitting up in bed and laughing. On being asked the
cause of the merriment, she replied,—</p>

<p>“As soon as I had retired, three women came into
the room on tip toe, whispering and pointing to me. I
feigned to be asleep and after some hesitation two of
them approached the bed and gazed at me a long time.
Then one of them quietly drew from between the coverlets
several skirts and other articles of wearing apparel.
They went out and I heard them giggling in the passage
way. In a short time they came in again and this
time pulled out from under the bed enough dishes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
set a table, and several packages. Then they, thinking
I was sound asleep, lifted up the eider-down at the
foot of the bed and drew out a big platter laden with
what I suppose was smoked fish.”</p>

<p>I had no sooner reached the room and was wondering
where I was to sleep, than these ladies came again
bringing more eider-down covers and a box. The box
was placed at the end of a chest, a bed was made upon
the combination and I turned in to await an early call.
But those two boxes were possessed to separate and I
found myself on the floor between them in a smother
of covers. I then made up my bed on the floor and in
the morning rearranged the boxes to give them the
appearance of having been used as intended. This I
did on the following night. The people did the best
they could to be hospitable, served us excellent food
and attended to every thing possible for our comfort,
even to removing our clothes and boots during the night
and cleaning them. True hospitality is in the spirit of
the service and not in the quantity or quality and this
fact must be recognized in order to do justice to these
friendly people.</p>

<p><i>Hekla</i> was our goal. Across the noisy river, out of
the folds of its mantle of wrinkled lava ridges, rose
the icy shoulders and hooded head which we hoped to
win this day. We engaged an additional guide at the
farm to go with Johannes and taking our best ponies,
Michael Sunlocks and Greba, we left the farm at six
in the morning. This is early in Iceland. From ten
to one is the usual hour for beginning the ride of the
day. A short trot across the field brought us to the
<i>Vestr-Rángá</i>, West-Wrong-River. There is an Eastern
as well as a Western “Wrong-River,” so named
because the eruptions of <i>Hekla</i> have so often changed
its course. We passed close to the <i>tún</i> of <i>Noefrhólt</i>,
Clever-Stony-Ridge. The stony ridge is there but why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
“clever” I can not surmise, unless the people have been
clever in dodging the big masses of rock that roll down
from the mountain. The buildings are close in under
the steep lava wall and there are hundreds of great
stones around the buildings, any one of which would
have destroyed them, that have tumbled down from
the mountain wall. Many homes have been demolished
in this country and people killed by the rolling stones.
This ridge is palagonitic conglomerate, the refuse of
preglacial eruptions. The term preglacial in Iceland
means the same as in other glaciated countries, but the
geological time is much more recent than in North
America. More of this when we reach the glaciers.
We climbed the ridge beside a beautiful stream of water
sluicing down a grooved ledge and saw two pairs of
Harlequin ducks, <i>Histrionicus minutus</i>, swimming in
the swift water. It is remarkable how these swimmers
can hold their position in such strong currents. The
bluish-gray plumage of the males slashed with bars of
white and the dark brown dress of the females made a
pretty picture as the lively birds zigzagged in the glistening
stream. They were quite fearless and did not
dive until we were within ten feet of them.</p>

<p>Coming to a great quadrangular enclosure in the
lava walls we stopped to rest and to feed the ponies, as
this is the last spot where grass can be obtained. The
great ridge to the right which is deep red and compact
like jasper is the lava of the recent eruption. It terminates
in a fissure in the mountain side far below the
summit. The wall to the left turned in front of us
in a long sweep to join the base of the above mentioned
rift. From our position no egress appeared from this
formidable <i>cul de sac</i> and we expected that the guides
would leave the ponies here with the ascent just begun
and that we would have this tangled mass of lava ropes
to scale as best we could. A mile further on a twist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
in the flow, where the viscid lava rose in a billow and
broke back upon itself, we found a precarious egress
which the ponies negotiated with the agility and sure-footedness
of mountain sheep. We dodged about between
the basalt fragments and over the ash ridges
rising higher and higher with every turn. The travelling
is somewhat dangerous in places, as I had occasion
to testify, the lava is full of cracks and holes and the
lichens have woven a treacherous carpet over this floor.
High above loom the red walls and the obsidian points
bristling like a <i>cheval-de-frise</i>. We had not yet reached
the snow line but the fog hung low upon the shoulders
of the mountain and we despaired of even a momentary
lifting of the mantle should we gain the summit. We
next came to an ash ridge so steep that we dismounted
and sometimes walking and sometimes riding we gained
the top of this ridge, an elevation of 2,000 feet above
the sea. Descending into a wild glen of chaotic fragments,
like huge masses of broken glass, we found a
patch of level sand and here we left the ponies. We
tied them in pairs, the head of one to the tail of the
other and here we left the poor beasts without food
or water till six at night to shiver in the blast.</p>

<p><i>Hekla</i> is situated thirty miles from the sea on the
south shore of the island. In clear weather it is easily
seen from the Westman Islands and is a fine spectacle
as it lifts its silvery mass above the great plain. It has
two peaks, craters. From these peaks extend northeast
and southwest a ridge of lava fifteen miles each. This is
the material that has belched from these craters and
more recently from the rifts deep down in the side of the
mountain. We made the ascent from the west. From
the eminence which we had gained we looked over the
country traversed during the past three days. The base
and the middle slopes are composed of contorted and
tangled skeins of lava which flowed at different periods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>,
the more recent ones adapting themselves to the older
ridges, sometimes filling the gullies and overflowing,
sometimes melting down thin barriers or baking the
ridges of ash and rubble into conglomerate, which someone
has aptly termed a “geological Irish stew.” The rolling,
spreading and twisting of these semi-fluid hot
streams, the terrible rough and punctured surface of the
lava, the sharp and glass-like angles, the pinnacles and
crevasses are better imagined than described. No adequate
idea can be obtained till one has made the ascent,
till one has had many a fall, cut his hands upon the
glass, scoured his boots on the needlepoints, lost his
breath and almost lost his temper,—till then he will remain
in ignorance of the true condition of <i>Hekla’s</i>
horrent surface. Now and again a patch of loose sand
or a pocket of snow gives respite from the sharp and
angular blocks that menace a cut with every step.</p>

<p>The ridge where we left the ponies commands a
grand view well worth the ascent to this point, even
though the traveller goes no further. Most people who
“make the ascent of <i>Hekla</i>” go no further than the
summit of this ridge, though it is only two-fifths of the
elevation of the mountain. We ate a portion of our
lunch, cached the remainder in a crevice under a rock,
and picked our way as best we could over a
tumbled pile of bristling lava for half an hour when
we arrived at the snow which was in exceptionally good
condition for walking. It lay in a narrow gulch between
two steep ridges of rock which extend up to
the steepest portion of the mountains. While we are
making this easy portion of the climb let us recount a
bit of <i>Hekla’s</i> history.</p>

<p><i>Hekla</i> is the greatest volcano in Iceland and in some
respects the greatest in the world. What makes a
volcano great? Is it the area of the base and its
altitude? Is it the number of recorded eruptions? Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
it the number of people it has destroyed together with
their flocks and herds? Is it the space of territory devastated
and the duration of any one or any series of its
eruptions? This volcano was doubtless active prior to
the settlement of the country as shown by the formation
of its slopes, but since 1004 there have been twenty-five
recorded eruptions, each of a serious nature to the country
and destructive of life and property. Some of these
eruptions have lasted only a few days and several for
months and the one beginning in 1766 lasted two years.
The great eruption was in 1845 and lasted seven months.
The shortest period between eruptions was from 1294
to 1300, only six years, and previous to this eruption the
volcano had been quiet for seventy-two years. The
longest period was between the last two eruptions, 1768
to 1845, seventy-seven years and this followed the long
eruption of two years. The average period of inactivity
from 1004 to 1845 is thirty-two years. These
figures do not take into account the frequent flowing of
lava from the rifts during the periods of so-called inactivity.
The following are the most memorable eruptions,—</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>1294 Eighth recorded eruption. There were violent
and destructive earthquakes throughout the country.
Great rifts in the old lava plains were opened.
The rivers were covered with pumice and many of them
changed their courses. New hot springs came into
existence and others disappeared. There was great
destruction of life and property.</p>

<p>1300 Ninth recorded eruption and following the
short period of six years of rest. This was one of the
most violent on record. Ashes covered hundreds of
miles of the north country. There were many severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
earthquakes and the destruction of the grass and livestock
produced a famine with resulting heavy loss of
life.</p>

<p>1436 Thirteenth recorded eruption. Many homesteads
and much arable land laid waste under a mantle
of scorching ashes.</p>

<p>1510 Fifteenth recorded eruption. Enormous volumes
of ash and pumice were poured out and myriads
of lava bombs were scattered for miles, which in falling
demolished houses and killed livestock and people.</p>

<p>1583 Sixteenth recorded eruption. This was excessive
in its violence. Thundering explosions were
audible throughout the island and continued for twelve
days with great violence. Eighteen columns of flaming
gases issued from as many different vents in the mountain.
Earthquakes destroyed many farms and hundreds
of the turf and stone dwellings were demolished.
There was a great loss of life.</p>

<p>1845 Twenty-fourth recorded eruption. It began
on September second and continued without cessation
for seven months. The ashes rose miles in the air and
were carried by the wind to the Shetland Islands and
to Norway. During this eruption, it is estimated that
500 feet in altitude of the top of the mountain was
blown into fragments and hurled in places to a distance
of fifteen miles or more. Hot sand, ashes and scoriae
were ejected in a constant fountain from the crater and
the mountain itself opened lower down, and from this
rift came the floods of lava that flowed for seven
months destroying everything in its path. It has been
estimated by the Danish survey that the mass of melted
rock poured out, (not counting sand, ash and scoriae),
from this rent is 14,500,000 cubic feet.</p>

<p>1913 Twenty-fifth recorded eruption. At three in
the morning of the twenty-fifth of April, Friday, there
was a violent earthquake shock in the region of <i>Hekla</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and several houses fell, notably the ancient one at <i>Galtalaekur</i>,
to which special reference has been made in this
chapter. Heavy smoke poured from two sources and
fine ashes fell between the <i>Thjórsá</i> and the <i>Hvitá</i>. On
the thirtieth of April the lava spouted over 1000 feet
into the air and on the first of May a rift opened that
was over 600 feet in length. Moderate action continued
until the eighth of May. During the eighth and
the ninth of May the action was violent and the outflowing
lava covered an area two miles in length by one
in width.</p>

<p><i>Krakatindr</i> is a small peak on the eastern slope of
the <i>Hekla</i> field and <i>Lambafell</i>, Lamb Mountain, is
another in the same locality. Here the eruption was
central and in the last mentioned ridge the lava broke
out in ten distinct places. It must be remembered that
the 1913 eruption of <i>Hekla</i> did not come from either
of the summit craters, but from the foot hills and buttresses
of this mountain. It must be regarded as an
eruption of <i>Hekla</i> when dealt with scientifically. The
mass of lava, slag and ashes on the summit of <i>Hekla</i>
will preclude any future activity within the ancient
craters; but, future action, like this of 1913, will take
place in rifts in the sides and at the foot of this volcano,
since it is in this lower crust that the mountain is weakest.</p>

<p>It was over the ruins of the 1845 eruption that we
had travelled for a day and it was those curled and
solidified streams of bristling and horrent lava over
which we have been making our snail-like pace to the
summit. When we speak of a great volcano we unconsciously
turn to Vesuvius but this is because of its
dramatic position in history and because it has enjoyed
more advertising than all other volcanoes in the world.
Because of the vineyards and the dense population upon
its slopes and the number of lives it has destroyed we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
thoughtlessly crown it the king of volcanoes. Had
the plains of <i>Hekla</i> enjoyed the mild climate of Naples
they would have supported many times the population
within the radius of the influence of Vesuvius and the
destruction of life due to <i>Hekla’s</i> eruption would have
totaled an appalling figure. Vesuvius was silent for
long centuries prior to 79 A. D. then came its ash
and mud eruption, then for about fifteen centuries it
was silent. Since that time its activity has been largely
spectacular. Lava rifts where molten rock pours out
continuously are beyond doubt the most terrible forms
of volcanic activity,—such has been the type of <i>Hekla</i>.
To answer the questions which introduced this topic,—the
things that make a volcano great are not the circumstances
of men. Its greatness lies in the number,
violence, duration and character of the eruptions, in the
quantity of molten material forced out, in the mass of
detritus ejected from the crater and the power with
which that material is vomited upon the earth. If
this definition of greatness is correct, then <i>Hekla</i> is
the greatest volcano of recorded time. It has been
little studied, never systematically, on account of its
remoteness.</p>

<p>At the upper end of the snow covered lava gulch we
turned to the right and the real snow climbing commenced.
At this place the mountain has a slope of
forty-five degrees. The snow was hard, too hard in
fact for sure footing, almost ice, and we were forced
to dig steps with our feet to support us while making
the next step. At the time we were on the mountain
there was an unusual amount of snow, which filled the
cracks and smoothed the angular projections of this
upper portion. On the steepest slopes the snow basely
rewarded our confidence and gave us many a backward
and ignominious slide.</p>

<p>While we were fastening the ponies, the feasibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of Mrs. Russell’s going further was questioned by
Johannes.</p>

<p>“Madam will stay with me till the guide and your
man return?”</p>

<p>“I am going to try the climb with Mr. Russell,” she
replied.</p>

<p>“The lady go to the top of <i>Hekla</i>! If the lady go
then Johannes will go, but I fear the lady will not go
far.”</p>

<p>When we were struggling up the steep snow slope,
I made steps in advance and Mrs. Russell, importuned
by Johannes and weary with the toil was ready to halt,
if she had received the least encouragement from me.</p>

<p>“The lady can go no further,” said Johannes to me
as he dug a hole in the snow for a seat, “and you must
not allow it.”</p>

<p>I replied, “she has travelled two days over a rough
country, fording the rivers and now she has almost won
the cinder cone. She will always be sorry in America
to have to say that she got <i>nearly</i> to the top and gave
up the struggle.” This I said, talking to Johannes
but for the benefit of “the lady.”</p>

<p>“Well, Johannes can go no further; Johannes is an
old man and he has pain in here,” placing his hand
over his stomach, “the <i>skyr</i> I ate this morning was
little and it not good to do <i>Hekla</i>-climb on.” So saying,
he dug his hole deeper and reclined in the snow
while we pushed our way over the remaining snow surface
to the cinder cone.</p>

<p>Yes, Johannes was an old man and a faithful one.
His action this day was a fine bit of Icelandic courtesy
and faithful service. Honestly he did not think it
wise for a woman to attempt the climb and being confident
that Mrs. Russell would not endure, he knew
that my climb of the mountain would be defeated if
I had had to turn back with her, so he trudged along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
manfully to be her companion when she ceased climbing
and await my return. When we were near enough
to the summit so that it was evident that “the lady”
would win, he halted and veiled his whole earnest efforts
under the excuse of his weakness. He was a
faithful man, constantly anticipating our wants and always
ready to exert himself for our comfort and
pleasure.</p>

<p>When we were on the glassy lava we wished we
were on the snow slope, when we were scaling and slipping
on the snow we wished we were on the lava. But
what of the cinder cone! That was short but it was
the worst of all. We made the ascent on a narrow
ridge like that of a roof. The loose material rolled
away and often took us backward with it. A false step
to either side of the ridge carried us down several
yards and it became a hand and foot scramble to regain
the lost position on the ridge. Near the very top if we
had made a false step towards the right we would have
been precipitated several rods into the creeping rubble
of multi-colored cinders, if the false step had been to
the left we would have fallen an equal distance on to
the snowbank in the rim of the crater.</p>

<p>During the last hour of the climb we were enveloped
in clouds and as we gained the summit snow was falling.
A sudden change in the direction of the wind swept
the clouds from the top of the mountain and we had
ten minutes of clear sky which afforded time for two
good photographs and a quick view of the surrounding
country. Mrs. Russell unfurled the flag of the Arctic
Club of America, the stars and stripes in the upper left
hand corner of an ice-green field. This flag had been
presented to me for this purpose by the late Rear Admiral
W. S. Schley, then president of the Arctic Club.
We have every reason to believe that Mrs. Russell was
the first woman to gain this point and I know that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
was the first time that the stars and stripes ever floated
from the summit of a volcano in Iceland.</p>

<p>The reading of the thermometer at the summit was
zero, Centigrade; the reading of the aneroid barometer,
carefully compared with the standard at the station in
<i>Reykjavik</i> before starting and corrected by the same
instrument for the same hour when we returned, gave
the elevation of <i>Hekla</i> as 5,050 feet. This is not a
high mountain but it has features peculiar to itself that
render its ascent one of toil. Any person with endurance
and thoughtful care can make the ascent and no
one who visits Iceland, if at all interested in the topography
of the country or in volcanic formations, can afford
to miss it.</p>

<p>I climbed down to the brink of the crater upon the
snow shelf to view the interior and to photograph the
opposite wall. No ascent had been made for four years
and at that time the local guide stated that the crater
was full of snow and ice. This is the ash crater of
1845. The opening is about 450 by 360 feet. When
I looked into its depths on July 20, 1909, there was
no snow in the bottom and vapor was ascending. This
vapor was doubtless snow evaporation. Yet, there has
been some heat radiation from within to clear out
this great cavity of ice and snow in four years. Fifteen
minutes walk along the ridge brings the traveller to the
red crater, which is about the same size as the other
or northern crater but unlike it the material is red with
considerable sublimated sulfur.</p>

<p><i>Hekla</i> is by no means dead. Numerous earthquakes
have occurred in its vicinity within the past three years
and a large area of the ice mantle is reported as having
slipped off in 1910. It is sixty-nine years since the
great eruption of 1845, which is more than twice the
average period of inactivity but it is nine years less than
its longest period of rest. An eruption may be expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
at any time. The old volcano, in spite of the
slander which Burton heaps upon it, is worthy of scientific
study and before its next eruption a series of observations
should be taken similar to those made by
Frank Perret on Vesuvius and other Mediterranean
volcanoes.</p>

<p>The view from <i>Hekla</i> is superb. The eye is first
arrested by the ridges of lava, black, red, gray, horrent
and ill-boding which extend down the mountain
slopes and bury themselves in the fertile soil of the
distant plains. Each of the two main ridges bisects a
well watered section, once fertile and now choked with
sand. To the northwest, <i>Láng Jökull</i> raises its two
score miles of ice-parapet, four hundred miles of unexplored
Iceland; to the northeast is spread out the vast
expanse of mighty <i>Vatna Jökull</i>, Mountain-Producing-Waters,
an area of ice-covered tableland one hundred
miles by sixty; between these two glaciers and directly
north of us stands <i>Hofs Jökull</i>, <i>Hof</i> signifying heathen-temple,
it is nearly circular and appears like the frosted
dome of a mammoth cake. Between the last two
<i>Jökulls</i>, stretching away into the northeast, is the
<i>Sprengisandur</i>, Bursting-Sands, a mighty desert entirely
void of vegetation, a dreary, desolate tract, wind-driven
and life-destroying. Nearer, in the emerald plain flow
the glacier-born rivers the <i>Thjórsá</i> and the <i>Hvitá</i> and
a cloud of saffron sand floats in the air above the desert
which we crossed yesterday. We cannot see the travellers
but surely there is a train of horses there and the
wind is lifting the fine sand into the sun. Turn now
to the southward, look down along the tumbled chimneys
and the red hornitos of <i>Hekla</i> and the first object to
arrest the eye is the beautiful <i>Tindfjallajökull</i>, Peaked-Ice-Mountain,
with its two ice-horns resembling the
Matterhorn, protruding from an oval mound of lava
and casting their blue shadows on the trackless snow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Behind this mountain is the <i>Saga</i> country of the South,
the home of the noble <i>Njal</i> and the peerless <i>Gunnar</i>.
There was the scene of Iceland’s great Epic, Burnt
Njal. Those ribbons of limpid silver that branch from
the base of <i>Goðalands Jökull</i>, Land-of-the-Gods, like
reins from the hand of a chariot driver, those are the
many branches of the <i>Markarfljót</i>, Boundary-Marking-River,
pouring down its floods of glacial waters and
volcanic sands to choke the passage in an effort to join
<i>Heimaey</i> to the mainland. Across the moors, the sheep
ranges and the marshes beyond, the North Atlantic,
encircling the black masses of the Westman Islands,
wreathes those weathered pillars with garlands of snow-white
foam.</p>

<p>The descending clouds and the falling snow suddenly
shut off the view, but the camera of the eye has caught
it all in a circling panorama and the prints are stored
in memory’s folder to be opened at leisure. The infinite
waste of the lava billows, grandeur rising from
desolation, the flash of the restless rivers, the quiet of
the happy plain,—these are but the halftones in Iceland’s
matchless print.</p>

<p>The descent of the mountain was quickly made and
without incident. The slide down the semi-glacial cone
was a matter of pure enjoyment. We passed out of the
snowstorm and the cloud at the base of the cinder pile
into perfect sunshine with all the loveliness of the western
section to gladden the eye. Johannes rested by his
nap in the snow cradle joined us in the sport of rolling
lava blocks down the declivity. To roll stones down a
mountain slope, pitting one against another with equal
chances for winning the race, is a delightful pastime,
but when the racecourse is a bed of ice and the goal
a distant lava ridge against which the contestants dash
themselves into powder one is apt to linger till the last
desirable stone has been turned. Many a slip and tumble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
added zest to the descent, for each slide was so
much gained and no ground could be lost and we
laughed at the brevity of the steps in the upward trail.
We were happy, having done one of the things which
we had gone to Iceland to attempt.</p>

<p>We found the ponies shivering in the circle of sand
where we had left them. In their desire to turn their
heavy tails towards the wind for a protection, each
pony of the pair had walked around his tethered neighbor
till a well trodden path had been produced, a narrow
circle out of which they had not stepped. We
ate a hasty lunch and mounted. Once down the steep
rubble hill, away they went at a gallop, literally at a
break-neck speed, for they were cold and hungry and
longed for the grass by the brook of the harlequin
ducks. I came near to having my neck broken. When
we entered the amphitheater above described, I dismounted
to take a photograph. The ponies always
travel in single file, nose to tail, no matter how fast
the pace. If one of them is held back he will whinner
and do his utmost to overtake the leaders. Under these
conditions of photographing I always thrust my left
arm through the bridle rein. If the ponies are together
the rein may be thrown upon the ground, the
ponies will not stray but allow the riders to approach
and remount without their stirring. Sunlocks walked
rapidly around me, a somewhat disturbing element in
photographing. When I remounted, the other ponies
had passed out of the amphitheater and beyond vision.
Sunlocks was all impatience to overtake them and I
gave him a free rein for the wildest gallop I ever
experienced. He followed the trail of the others, tossing
the lichens from the resounding shell of lava at
every leap. It happened in an instant, a flash. I just
remember of thinking, while I was in the air, “Will he
hit me with his hoofs?” Then all was a blank. I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
no more till I felt his velvet nose rubbing over my face
and his warm breath. How long I lay there I do not
know. The crust had broken under the plunging blow
of his fore-feet and as he went into the hole I shot over
his head down the slope. I landed on the side of my
head, straining the cords of my neck which were sore
for months, in a bunch of sand and lichens, the only
spot in sight that was softer than the rock. Picking
up the camera case I remounted after several failures.
How I finally accomplished it and rode on I do not
know. Half an hour afterwards I overtook the party
who had long been waiting and was sending Johannes
back to look for me. I was still in a dazed condition
when I rode up to Mrs. Russell and when she asked me
the cause of the delay she states that I replied with this
question,—</p>

<p>“Is my head on straight?”</p>

<p>It was a narrow escape for horse and rider and I
have never since ridden the lava sheets at a gallop.
Poor Michael Sunlocks! His fore-legs were bruised
and he was stiff and lame for several days. Why he
stayed with me in spite of his desire to overtake his
mates I do not understand. It is a trait of the Icelandic
<i>hestr</i>. I have had several tumbles from my ponies since
that summer and at no time did any of them leave me.
My friends sometimes ask why I extol the Icelandic
pony. My explanation is that they are intelligent beyond
the intelligence of other horses, the sole dependent
of the traveller in a roadless country and that one
of them gave up the impulse to join his companions
in the grass patch when I was in sore need.</p>

<p class="dropcap">From <i>Galtalaekur</i> we turned towards the sea.
All the long day we traversed the sands of
<i>Hekla</i> and the bordering marshes. In the latter
there is an abundance of the sand reed,
<i>Elymus arenarius</i>, growing to a height of four feet or
more with heavy panicles nodding in the wind. In
times of famine the seeds of this plant have often
been ground and used to make bread. Innumerable
trails cross each other in these plains and exact knowledge
of the locality is necessary in order to avoid wandering.</p>

<p>We overtook a girl of fourteen on the back of a
pony. To the tail of the pony was tied a string of
ponies, nose to tail in the Icelandic fashion. Each pony
carried two huge cans of milk, one on either side in a
bag suspended from a peg in the pack saddle. The
girl made the long ride to the creamery and back each
day and alone. She, like the lad at <i>Hruni</i>, was improving
her time in study. As the ponies always
walked to avoid churning the milk, she had ample time
to read. In ways like this the youth of Iceland, deprived
of modern educational advantages, employ their
time in study for the pleasure it gives. When study
is a pleasure, ignorance is baffled. The milk establishment
being near our trail, we entered it to compare it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
with the fine institutions of this character in other lands.
The comparison was wholly favorable to Iceland. Within
the building extreme cleanliness was manifest in the
spotless floor, the white aprons and caps of the dairy-maids
and the glistening implements of the industry.
The Icelandic creamery is on a sound scientific basis
and conducted on a strictly coöperative plan. Modern
machinery is employed which is operated with water
power. A laboratory opens out of the weighing and
sampling room and it is well equipped for expert testing.
The maid in charge showed us the lists of the
coöperating farms, the fat percentages and butter
yields. The milk is received on the basis of the yield
of butter fats and the skim milk from the separators
is returned to the farmers. The butter is shipped in
great casks to England and successfully competes with
the fine product of Denmark. In the best grazing centers
there are several of these creameries under the general
supervision of the Agricultural College.</p>

<p>Iceland could produce many more tons of choice butter
from the abundance of the nutritious grass which
clothes the summer pastures, if the hay crop were of
sufficient quantity to warrant the keeping of extra cows
through the long winter. Grass grows in abundance
but the low temperature and the short summer prevent
it from coming to full maturity so that the home fields
are cut long before the grass is ripe and often before
it forms the seed heads. Frequently it is only six inches
high at the time of cutting. Given a little warmer summer
to produce more grass and Iceland would become
a flourishing dairy land.</p>

<p>These grassy plains border two places of historical
importance in Iceland. This is the margin of the <i>Njal
Country</i>. At the foot of the trifingered mountain in the
fertile plains of the <i>Markarfljót</i> is <i>Hlíðarendi</i>, Grass-Slope,
the home of <i>Gunnar</i> of <i>Saga</i> fame. In his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
day <i>Hekla</i> had wrought but little of the present desolation
and the land was rich in flocks and herds cared for
by numerous thralls. The ice-capped mountain rose
behind the farm and towards the sea sloped the productive
meads. <i>Gunnar</i> and his friend, <i>Kolskegg</i>, were
exiled for three winters for the part they had taken
in a blood feud. As they rode down to the <i>Lithe</i> on
their way to take ship to foreign shores, <i>Gunnar’s</i>
horse stumbled and threw him. As he rose to his feet
he looked towards his pleasant home and exclaimed,—“Fair
is the <i>Lithe</i>; so fair that it has never seemed to
me so fair; the corn fields are white to harvest, and
the home mead is mown; and now I will ride back
home, and will not fare abroad at all.”</p>

<p>If an outlawed man refused within the given time
to go into the specified exile, any one could slay him
without breaking any law. This his enemies took advantage
of and during the following autumn killed him
in his house.</p>

<p>Near at hand is <i>Oddi</i>, Point, as of land, made famous
by the school of <i>Saemund Sigfusson</i>, the Learned,
a popular center of learning in the ancient days of Icelandic
glory. Here, also, in 1181 went the youthful
<i>Snorri Sturlason</i> then only three years of age, into fostering.
This school was called the “highest-head-stead”
which signifies that it was not only the wealthiest in
Iceland but the most renowned for scholarship. <i>Snorri</i>
was an apt pupil, a brilliant scholar and one who delved
deeply into the old Latin manuscripts, long since lost,
in the rich library at <i>Oddi</i>. It was here that he acquired
the knowledge of European history which gave
birth to his story of the Round World, <i>Heimskringla</i>,
a story of the Kings of Norway. <i>Snorri</i> was the first
pragmatic historian who ever wrote in the Teutonic
language. To him are indebted the German and the
English historians of later days, though they do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
always take the trouble to acknowledge it. Without
his gleanings from that old library at <i>Oddi</i> many pages
of history would be missing. That he was faithful we
may well believe when we note the following from his
preface:—</p>

<p>“In this book have I let write tales told concerning
those chiefs who have borne sway in the Northlands,
and spake the Danish tongue, even as I have heard
men of lore tell the same; and also certain of their lines
of kindred according as they have been taught to me.
Some of this is found in the Tales of Forefathers,
wherein kings and other men of high degree have
traced their kin; but some is written after olden songs
or story-lays, which men have had for their joyance.
Now though we wot not surely the truth thereof, yet
this we know for a truth, that men of lore of old time
have ever held such lore for truth.” Again,—</p>

<p>“Now it is the manner of scalds, (poets), to praise
those most whom they stand before while giving forth
their song, but no one would dare to tell the king himself
deeds, which all who harkened, yea and himself
withal, wotted well were but windy talk and lying;
for no praise would that be, but mocking rather.”</p>

<p>At <i>Thjórsátún</i>, Farm of Bull-River, we found modern
buildings constructed of wood with many continental
conveniences. The farmer, <i>Ólafur Isleifsson</i>, had
lived in Winnipeg about six years and had returned
to his native land with many western ideas. He spoke
some English and was glad to greet travellers from
America. It was a relief to find a bed of sufficient
length to permit one to stretch at full length. The food
was cooked on a real iron stove and we were treated
to a beef steak, the first we had seen in the country.
The salmon were fresh and broiled to a turn, the coffee
excellent as usual, and with rolls, cheese and eggs we
made a substantial meal, having been without food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
for ten hours. It was a cool night and having a slight
chill, I gave the hot water bag to the host with the
request that he fill it with hot water. He looked at it
with a peculiar expression as if wondering how it could
be used as a drinking vessel. On its return it was
filled with ice-cold water. As it is the Icelandic custom
to bring drinking water to the guest on retiring, the
farmer evidently thought we preferred the rubber bag
to the customary glass bottle. Anticipating the luxury
of the hot water and promising with every shiver to restore
quiet to my quivering limbs the disappointment
was keen. I had not the courage to call attention to
his mistake by asking a second time but replied as
cheerfully as I could, “<i>tak</i>,” thanks.</p>

<p>This farm is located on a high bank overlooking the
broad expanse of rolling lava and grass lands through
which the canyon of the <i>Thjórsá</i> extends. A fine suspension
bridge spans the flood and the view of the
white water foaming down the rift is excellent. Beyond
the river a good road, the post road, leads all the
way to <i>Eyrarbakki</i>, Beach-Bank. The country is level
and produces an abundance of grass. This section contains
nearly all the made roads in Iceland. When we
passed we noticed much activity in road construction
and in the erection of telephone lines. These roads
will be of great value to the farmers in this section who
are just beginning to use carts with two wheels after
transporting their produce on the backs of ponies for
about twelve hundred years. The ponies do not enjoy
the harness, but prefer the saddle. During these days
we met many ponies hauling telephone poles and grading
material. Every one of them had a dejected look
much like that of a new convict. We fancied that the
saddle ponies, as they called to the prisoners in the
harness, realized the better condition of their own labor
and that they looked down upon the plodders in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
thills, much as the chauffeur looks upon the pedestrian
as he envelopes that individual with dust. The made
road is not liked by the pony, accustomed to travel the
crooked trails, which in the lowlands are always soft,
and he shuns the hard roads whenever he can. The
trails are much easier for the rider as there is less
pounding in the saddle. After a journey of a thousand
miles on the lowland and upland trails, the following
summer our last day’s ride was from <i>Thingvellir</i>
to <i>Reykjavik</i> a distance of thirty-five miles over a hard
macadamed road, and it was the hardest day’s ride
of the two summers.</p>

<p>We rode along the base of a lofty table land, a giant
block of basalt shaped like a mesa, which is called
<i>Ingölfsfjall</i>, <i>Ingölf’s</i>-Mountain. At the request of
<i>Ingölfr</i>, who was the first real settler in Iceland, he
was buried at the top of this mountain. He said,—</p>

<p>“I wish to be buried there in order that I may behold
my vast possessions from its summit at the last
day.”</p>

<p>The <i>fata Morgana</i> tantalized us all the afternoon
as we rode down to the sea. The village of <i>Eyrarbakki</i>
loomed high above the level plain and we were surprised
at the extreme height of the houses until they
disappeared, all but the tops. Looming up into the
vibrating air and sinking into the sand they alternated
with the shifting strata of variously heated air. Late
in the afternoon the objects on the shore became fixed
and real, like other houses in the country. We clattered
up the one street by the sea to the home of <i>Fru Eugenia
Nielsin</i>. It is the finest house in the village and a portion
of it is over two hundred years old. There are
stone and turf houses in Iceland that are much older but
this one is constructed entirely of wood. The <i>Neilsins</i>
are Danish merchants engaged in the wool and fish
trade and importers of general supplies for the farmers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
We found <i>Fru Neilsin</i> a delightful hostess, who
exerted herself to make our short stay one long to be
remembered with gratitude. Back of the house was
an excellent garden with some splendid potatoes; in
front there was a well kept lawn, almost English in
character, and here we enjoyed croquet at eleven at
night. The village has a population of about three
hundred people, mostly engaged in fishing. I examined
the lumber yard and noted a high grade of Norway
spruce. Although not a stick of timber grows in Iceland
it can be purchased at less than half the price
asked in New England.</p>

<p>Within the house we found refinement and comfort,
culture and hospitality. As fortunes are reckoned in
Iceland these people are wealthy. The household furnishings
are valuable for their antiquity and the handicraft
with which they were constructed. It is not
the writer’s intention to describe the furnishings
of the different homes in which he has been entertained
nor to differentiate in degrees of hospitality.
The welcome and the entertainment were sincere and
as cordially proffered in the poorest hut in the mountains
as in the more favored homes by the sea. This
being the only Danish home in the country where we
were entertained, justice demands that we make it clear
to the reader that the modern Dane is not lacking in
the inborn hospitality of his ancient race. We frequently
found proof of this on the little Danish ships
plying between Iceland and Copenhagen and in Copenhagen
itself. And so <i>Fru Neilsin</i> set her table with
her finest service and her Icelandic kitchen maid produced
a dinner that night for two hungry travellers
that would have done credit to the chef of a first class
hotel.</p>

<p>Entertainment has a different meaning to an American
after he has experienced it in Iceland. What would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Americans think if two foreigners, travel-soiled, unable
to speak their language, should ride upon their
lawns, throw the bridle to the ground, and through an
interpreter make a request, much in the nature of a
demand, for food and lodging? I fear that in most
cases they would be cooly invited to continue their
journey. Not so in Iceland. The stranger is taken to
the best room, provided with soap, towels and food.
His riding habit is taken away to be cleaned and returned
in the morning when the morning cup of coffee
and the cakes are taken to the bed room. The breakfast,
like the dinner, is of the best the house can afford,
the ponies are taken to the door, you pay the modest
reckoning and ride away conscious of a kindly and generous
liberality.</p>

<p>The <i>Ölfusá</i>, as the lower end of the <i>Hvitá</i> is called,
is a mighty river. It receives the waters of <i>Thingvallavatn</i>,
the <i>Laxá</i>, the <i>Túngufljót</i>, <i>Varmá</i>, Warm-River,
and several other tributaries. At the sea this
lake narrows to half a mile by a projecting bank of
sand. The flood of water pours out this narrow channel
at low tide with a strong current. The water is icy
cold and it is so laden with glacial clay that it is still
“<i>Hvitá</i>,” White River. At <i>Óseyri</i>, Beach-Mouth, we
obtained a boat and two local guides, who knew the
river, to ferry us across. We waited for low tide as it
is impossible to swim the ponies across this broad estuary
at high tide. The boat was taken half a mile up
stream to allow for the drift of the current in crossing,
the ponies were stripped of saddles, bridles and
packing cases and Johannes tied a cod line around the
lower jaw of each horse and left the lines about eight
feet long. All the luggage was placed in the bottom
of the leaky boat with the packing boxes at the bottom.
We sat on the top of the baggage and the two oarsmen,
stout fellows, worked the boat into the stream. Johannes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
handled the ponies in the following manner. He
knelt in the stern of the dory with four of the lines in
each hand. The ponies hung back for some time, as the
cold and rapidly flowing water frightened them. It
required full five minutes of careful coaxing to bring
them into the water beyond their depth. This was a
delicate bit of oar work as the current tended to sweep
the boat sideways towards the shore and against the
legs of the ponies. As the ponies were swept off their
feet and began to swim the current caught the boat
sideways and it required all the energy of the two oarsmen
to back water sufficiently to relieve the strain upon
the towing lines and at the same time keep the boat
pointed across the stream. The tethers were kept sufficiently
taut to enable Johannes to keep their noses
above the water and we now discovered why Johannes
had tied the cords around their jaws. He watched
them with care and as soon as one nose plunged below
the water he gave that pony his whole attention and
with the strong cord pulled the pony’s nostrils to the
surface and held it there till it had blown out the
water. One after another, and sometimes two at a
time, they succumbed to the cold water and to the difficulty
of swimming so closely together. Only one of
the eight swam the entire distance without sinking and
this was the fiery “Jog Joggensen,” my afternoon
mount. Away we went down stream, boat and horses
together, the ponies checking the stern of the boat, the
current swinging the bow downwards, requiring the
utmost exertion of the oarsmen to point it towards the
opposite shore. It seemed as if we would be swept
over the bar and out to sea before we could win the
beach. To add to the difficulty the boat leaked frightfully
and held over a foot of water by the time we
landed. The plunging and snorting ponies, the wild
rush of the waters sweeping out of the estuary at low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
tide, the roar of the breakers just below, the countless
gulls and tern circling over our heads, the rapidly sinking
boat and the anxiety depicted on the face of Johannes,
made this anything but a pleasant crossing.
Around us the seal thrust their shining heads above
the water, questioned with their eyes our right to invade
their ancient domain and dived to reappear on a
different quarter. The bow touched the sand, Johannes
cast off the eight lines, we jumped into the water and
waded ashore and the ponies staggered up the slope and
lay down exhausted in the sand. They speedily recovered,
rolled repeatedly to dry themselves and we
allowed them a brief rest before resaddling.</p>

<p>When the boat touched land at the very verge of the
breakers with the sand streaming away from us as the
waves crawled back into the sea, at least one member
of the party gave a sigh of relief. It has always been
a disputed point as to which one of us uttered that
sigh. Many ponies have been lost at this crossing by
being swept out to sea. We were fortunate in saving
all of ours, but Johannes stated that he had lost several
in this tide race. As we lifted the packing cases out
of the water in the boat it was with grave fears as to the
condition of the camera films, for the water had filled
all spaces within those cases.</p>

<p>At noon we arrived at a small farm under a high
cliff at some distance from the sea. It is called <i>Hlíðarendi</i>,
(not to be confounded with <i>Hlíðarendi</i>, the home
of <i>Gunnar</i>), the usual Icelandic farm in an unusual situation.
The buildings stand at the back of an amphitheatre.
The surrounding cliffs are five hundred feet
in elevation above the buildings. At the base of the
cliff three generous streams of water flow out of the
mountain. This is water that has sunk into the moorland
near the base of the distant mountains and has
found a passage through the cracked lava. Climbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to the top of the bluff I found an extensive moorland
where numerous sheep were grazing and hundreds of
whimbrels and plover. I spent two hours in stalking
the plover with the camera. They finally allowed me
to approach within fifteen feet of them. In the winter
several hundreds of ptarmigan live upon this heath and
the farmer shoots them for the English market. They
are shipped in a frozen condition and are used in the
London Clubs.</p>

<p>The view from the bluffs is extensive. At the foot
of the cliffs lay the <i>tún</i> dotted with bundles of hay. Beyond
the <i>tún</i> extends a waste of lava blocks and sand
and then the sea, blue and surging. To the north
rises range above range of the barren volcanoes of
<i>Reykjaness</i>, Smoking Cape. I found the descent of the
bluffs much more difficult than the ascent. The cliffs
are clothed with a rich carpet of grass and an abundance
of flowers in full bloom. Here the <i>Spiraea</i> lifts its
purple spikes high above the grass, the dandelions and
<i>Arnica</i> sprinkle the area with patches of bright yellow:
beside the water pockets and embedded in the sphagnum
moss the orchids bloom profusely: wild geraniums
fringe the angular lava and many plants peculiar
to this high latitude fill in the remainder of the floral
scheme.</p>

<p>Mrs. Russell had considerable labor in restoring
order to the packing cases and in spreading our clothes
upon the rocks to dry. In the passage of the <i>Ólfusá</i>,
our cases filled with water though they were supposed
to be waterproof. The jog, jog, jog of the ponies had
stirred up towels, soap, bread, tobacco, camera films,
cocoa, tea, note books and other items and churned
these ingredients into one common mass with salt water
better than it could have been done with any Yankee
washing machine. This was the reason we ended our
journey at noon this day. The camera films were uninjured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
as I had taken the precaution to place each film
in a metal box and seal it. These same boxes have
since been around the world with another traveller and
did similar excellent service for him in the jungles
of India. All camera films taken to Iceland for transportation
on a pony should be soldered water proof.
They are easily opened and the empty tin will take the
exposed film. This can may be securely sealed against
moisture by winding the joint with several turns of
waterproof tape.</p>

<p>I turned to the hayfield and finding an unused rake
I went to work, not that I needed the exercise after my
climb of the bluffs, but that I might have further excuse
for observing the people at their work. I have
previously made several observations about the haying
and the tools but there remain other items of interest.
The rake may be called a fine toothed comb. It is
made in the usual form of the American hand rake
with the exception of the teeth, which are from an inch
to an inch and a half in length and set closely together.
They are whittled out of the tough and crooked roots
of the Arctic birch. This implement serves its purpose
admirably, for it gathers all the short fine hay.
The Icelandic scythe has been described, but it remains
to mention an instrument not used in America, the
<i>reipe</i>, rope. This consists of two eyelets whittled out
of wood or more often fashioned from a ram’s horn.
The eyelets are connected with a rope a foot long. To
each eyelet, and at right angles to the connecting rope,
there is attached another rope which is from twelve to
eighteen feet in length. In use these two ropes are
laid in parallel on the ground, the hay is heaped upon
the center to a weight of eighty to one hundred pounds.
The eyelets are then brought up to the top of the heap,
the corresponding rope from the other side is then
brought up to its eyelet and passed through, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
free ends are drawn taut by the force of two men,
a half hitch is taken in each, the ends are then turned
at right angles to their original position and passed
round to the other side of the bundle and fastened just
as a box is tied in a store. Out of the loose ends is
fashioned a loop to hang the bundle on the pin of the
hay saddle. The bundle is then thoroughly combed out
with the rake and it is ready for transportation to the
haystack. If it rains or if the hay is not sufficiently
cured, the bundle is left in the field. Hay makes rapidly
in these bundles and a long rain will not penetrate.
Haying is the only agricultural pursuit in the
country. Each farmer keeps account of the number of
pony loads taken to the stacks each season. An average
crop for the country is about 1,800,000 pony loads
which average one hundred and ninety pounds per pony
load. Of this hay 1,000,000 loads are taken from the
wild land, that is, from the land outside of the <i>tún</i>.
This wild land is the moorland, unfed patches in the
pastures, islands, bogs and meadows. The <i>tún</i> is fertilized
with the manure from the cow stables. Each
day this material is carried out on a stretcher by the
milk maids and piled in a heap. This material dries
into a hard cake during the summer. When the time
comes for spreading it upon the <i>tún</i> it is broken up
and the fragments are placed in a toothed hopper and
ground. There are hundreds of tons of this best of
all fertilizers that go to waste as the soil does not need
it. If the soil could be sufficiently warmed by the sun
to produce garden crops Iceland would become a great
market garden for Europe as its soil is exceptionally
rich and fertilizer is abundant. Every farm has its
potato patch and a bed of turnips in a high walled
enclosure near the buildings but the farmer raises only
what he needs for his own family. The ground is
spaded and the potatoes are planted in beds as we plant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
beets and lettuce. There may be ploughs, mowing machines,
pitchforks and hayracks in Iceland but I have
never seen them on any of the many farms I have visited.
I have seen a photograph purporting to be from
Iceland which shows some of these instruments but
there are other items in the picture, such as the costumes
of the people, which prove that the negative
was made in Sweden.</p>

<p>The ride along the sea coast to <i>Krisuvik</i> is mostly a
scramble over a mass of lava which is strangely contorted
and blistered. A mountain bluff extends parallel
with the coast line about a mile from the shore. Prior
to the settlement of the country an eruption of one of
the volcanoes in this region poured out a large volume
of fluid lava which rolled over this bluff in several
places and then meandered in various directions. During
an entire day’s ride we saw but two houses, comfortless
homes of fishermen on a barren shore and far
from neighbors. This is a bird shore. Many thousands
of sea birds nest in this rough country, far away
from sheep and dogs, in undisputed freedom, for they
are seldom disturbed by man. Oftentimes the ground
for several square rods was literally covered with them.
When our trail led through these patches the old birds
resented our intrusion, swooped down and pecked at
the horses and at our clothing. We were forced to
keep one hand in continual motion about our heads to
prevent being violently hit with their wings. Over my
desk hangs a quill pen made from the wing feather of
the great black backed gull, which I tore from this bird
as it swooped against my arm.</p>

<p>We took lunch this day at <i>Stranda Kirkja</i>, Church-by-the-Strand,
beside a stream of brackish water which
flowed from under the lava wall. It was cool but unsatisfactory
as a beverage. We found it too sour to
drink. It contained some acid, probably sulfuric,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
though I had no barium chlorid with which to prove it.
After lunch we forded the shallows at the mouth of
the nearly land-locked bay of <i>Vogsósar</i>, Whale-Mouth,
and descended to the shore over a billowy mass of ropy
lava. Numerous tide pools were scattered about and
in them were countless eider duck with their young as
well as many other species. It is well for these birds
and for the people who gain a livelihood from their
eggs, down and feathers that the sportsman knows
nothing of these breeding places and that the sound
of the shotgun never wakes the echoes of these basaltic
cliffs.</p>

<p>We found our way by following a zigzag line of
cairns. It was rough travelling. Oftentimes the ponies
were forced to raise their fore feet to the edge of a
block of stone or lava shelf and then spring to the
top like goats, again in descending these stone stairways
they crouched like a cat for a spring, carefully lowered
one foot into a niche, placed the other fore foot in a
similar niche below it and then jumped to the lower
level. Never did they slip or make a false step, left
to their own guidance they picked the best places and
brought us safely across a mass of fractured lava that
seemed impossible for them to traverse. Certainly horses
of other countries could not have accomplished this
feat. Thus climbing and descending, fording shallows
and circling tide pools to the annoyance of the birds we
traversed ten miles of a wild and interesting country,
absolutely primaeval as far as any trace of man’s presence
is concerned save in the scattered cairns and the
deep grooves of his horses hoofs in the lava. In one
place I measured a trail ten rods long across the smooth
ledge that had been worn to a depth of seven inches and
a width of eight inches by the tiny feet of the ponies
during a thousand years of travel along this shore.</p>

<p>Leaving the sea we climbed a ridge of slag and ash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
debris of brilliant and variegated colors. Great masses
of this material, shaped like ropes of molasses candy
that has been pulled, were scattered beside the trail and
mingled with thousands of volcanic bombs. From this
summit we looked across a green valley to <i>Eldborg</i>,
Burning-Dome, and beyond to the pleasant farm of
<i>Krisuvik</i>.</p>

<p>We were comfortably housed and more than the
usual attention was given to our comfort. Here we
met an old acquaintance of the <i>Laura</i>, M. phil. Carl
Küchler from Varel in Oldenberg, Germany. We had
found him a pleasant acquaintance, a man who had
travelled widely in Iceland, speaking the Icelandic and
an author of several books in German upon Iceland.
We were pleased to renew the acquaintance. He has
since been decorated by the King of Denmark for the
work he has done in Iceland.</p>

<p>The columns of steam rising from the hills beyond
the meadow and the roar of the escaping gases attracted
our attention and it was with impatience that
we changed the riding habit for a lighter one and
started across the fields to examine the spot which
Hooker in 1813 described as, “One of the most awfully
impressive scenes that the world can furnish, or
even imagination can conceive.” This is strong language.
Had Hooker visited the solfatara of <i>Krafla</i> his
description would have been of interest. We shall see
that <i>Krafla</i> is intensely more interesting than <i>Krisuvik</i>.</p>

<p>It seemed but a short walk, a quarter of a mile at
most, from the house to the columns of steam belching
from the side of the hill. Although we were accustomed
to the deceptive distances in this clear atmosphere,
this time we were thoroughly deluded. That
walk of ten minutes lengthened into one of an hour as
the distance proved to be fully three miles. Crossing
the meadow we climbed a gentle slope of clay and sulfur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to the very edge of the solfatara. What a weird
and impressive scene it is! Every beauty of form and
color, every horror of sound and odor are here united.
Unnumbered tons of sublimed sulfur are piled in banks
and pyramids at the base of the cliffs. Great pools of
boiling bolus hiss, splutter and stink. The air is foul
with hot hydrogen sulfid and stifling with sulfur dioxid.
Wavering columns of steam render the walking dangerous
as oftentimes one can not see the place where he
is about to set his foot. We crunched through the
beds of monoclinic crystals and frequently slumped into
them to the knee and when we pulled the leg from the
hole a new column of steam shot into the air. Geologists
who have examined this place have had unpleasant
experiences because of approaching too near to the centers
of activity. Hooker states that “In endeavoring
to avoid one of these unpleasant gusts, (of steam),
which threatened to annoy me while I was gathering
some specimens, I jumped up to my knees in a semi-liquid
mass of hot sulphur.” What a thing of beauty
is a hole in these warm sulfur needles! They are like
needles, three to six inches long and glisten with the
purest amber glow. The viscid mass of clay and mineral
earths stick to the boots and it is often a task to
withdraw the feet from the clinging mess. The appearance
of the surface is deceitful, for often when
it seems most secure the crust breaks and a spurt of
hot steam shoots up beside the leg in a very unpleasant
manner. A thin hard crust of sulfur often conceals a
seething mass of the same material and one literally
walks, “<i>Perignes, suppositos cineri doloso</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Elevated
rims about the sizzling pools hold the viscid mass in
place except when a sudden eruption of steam causes
the material to slop over the sides of the basins in a
frightful manner. Add to this the steam-filled air, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
moaning of the cauldrons, the roar of the escaping
gases from a hole high up in the side of the talus and
the thought that the whole area may collapse into the
bowels of the earth or explode with volcanic force and
the mental situation is complete.</p>

<p>That vent in the cliff pours out its hot gases with
such a force that it sounds like the whistle of a locomotive
and the sound is plainly audible in the bedchamber
three miles distant. Day after day and century after
century this safety valve has been sounding and it is
sounding as we write,—an awful sound to unaccustomed
ears, a pleasant one to those who live within the
radius of this wide belt of volcanic activity, for it signifies
safety from violent eruption as long as the generating
forces beneath the surface are continually spent.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that there are no less than
250,000 tons of sulfur in this place and it is constantly
increasing by sublimation from below. The hot area is
on a line with hundreds of others of a like character,
active or temporally quiet, extending in a line from
<i>Krisuvik</i> to <i>Thingvallavatn</i>, a distance of thirty miles.
This line is also on the main diagonal of volcanic activity
extending from <i>Reykjaness</i> to <i>Mývatn</i> in the
northeast. Over five hundred square miles of the fire
peninsular is of recent volcanic origin and the subarea
is highly heated. Numerous hot springs abound,
fumaroles are without number, earthquakes are many,
lava frequently issues from the fissures in the mountain
sides and there is evidently beneath the crust of earth
another Phlegethon, that flaming river of the under
world in whose channel flowed flames instead of water.</p>

<p>Around <i>Krisuvik</i> there are many extinct craters filled
with water. <i>Gestavatn</i>, Guest-Lake, near the solfatara
is of this character. It is said to be without a bottom
but this is because it is funnel-shaped and very deep in
the center, which marks the old volcanic tube. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
strange that in the midst of this heated territory the
waters of this lake should be icy cold. It is a beautiful
sheet of water, so deep and so clear that it holds the
reflected blue of the sky appearing now to be a sheet
of lapis lazuli and now a sapphire blaze. Around its
margin a rim of grass and flowers thrive but beyond
the ring volcanic rubble and patches of sulfur and clay
displace the vegetation. At a greater distance the brilliant
surface of <i>Kleifavatn</i>, Cliff-Lake, reflects the encircling
bluffs and ragged gorges within whose recesses
a small herd of reindeer seek seclusion from the traveller.
Down by the sea the <i>Eldborg</i> stands, well worthy
of inspection. It is a mound-shaped crater with very
thin walls. It would seem as if Pluto was sparing of
his solid material when he built this funnel, for he
made it as frail as possible as if in haste to pour out
the molten matter in a flood upon the surrounding
plains. The shore side of the mountain is the home of
countless puffin, skua and other aquatic birds. Along
the sands of the sea the seal bask in the sunshine or
crawl back to their element with the retreating tide.
Taken as a whole, the <i>Krisuvik</i> region is a place of
fascination, even though one stands on the thin crust of
sulfur that feebly supports him, with fire and brimstone
in incessant action beneath his feet and clouds of
stifling and vile smelling gases enveloping him and
his ears are closed to all other sounds by the thundering
of the exploding steam. The beauty of the lakes and
fells, the peacefulness of the little farm and the kindness
of its owners make the traveller disposed to linger
till the margin of time between the present and the
sailing of the steamer from <i>Reykjavik</i> has been reduced
to a minimum.</p>

<p>It was a smiling Sunday morning when we reluctantly
packed for the last day of Icelandic travel and
turned our faithful steeds towards their home pastures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
for a much needed rest, little thinking that we would
return the following season for a more extended tour
and then again on the succeeding summer. On our
way towards <i>Reykjavik</i> we turned aside for one more
gaze at the alluring solfatara, for one more plunge into
the viscid sulfur, for one more sniff of its putrid air,
then, swinging around the shoulder of the smoking
bluffs we wound our tortuous way to the heights above,
dismounted and looked down for the last time upon
that scene so fair and yet so terrible. Upon the rim
of a great crater we held the ponies by the bridle rein
and silently absorbed the glories of the panorama. Below,—thousands
of tons of yellow sulfur sublimed in
Nature’s furnace sloped downward to the grassy fields
awaiting the coming of some genius of industry to
transmute it into the precious metal,—from the yellow
mounds rose the never ending columns of odorous
steam filling the air with quivering spirals and vibrating
with a weird incessant roar,—beyond, the lazy sea in
azure blue mirrored ten thousand waterfowl on its
burnished surface,—to the west, <i>Hengill</i>, arrests the
eye, its slopes wreathed in a hazy mantle of vapor issuing
from the encircling springs and fumaroles,—nearer,
the deep cerulean waters of the crater lakes,
the home of the wild swan and golden-eyed duck,
throw back the smiles of heaven,—southwest, <i>Reykjavik</i>
stands white against the black and ponderous cliffs of
<i>Esja</i>,—southward, <i>Faxafjörðr</i> cradles a hundred sailing
craft upon its bosom and beyond the fiord, great
<i>Snaefells Jökull</i> projects its cone of sparkling ice six
thousand feet where the north Atlantic mingles with
the icy waters of the Arctic Sea.</p>

<p>The ride of twenty-five miles to the capital city is
over a series of craters and across the <i>hraun</i> to <i>Hafnarfjörðr</i>,
Harbor-Fiord, thence by an excellent road
to <i>Reykjavik</i>. The crossing of the craters is of considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
interest to the geologist. The narrow trail
winds down the rim, across the floor strewn with ash
and scoriae then up the farther side and thus on from
crater to crater till the mountain side is reached then
down the mountain side by a winding, troublesome trail
to the valley. Here is met as wild a scene of desolation
as is to be found in the south of Iceland. The lava
flowed over the valley in great billows and out to the
ocean. What a commotion that was when the fluid rock
slipped hissing into the icy sea, what volumes of steam
filled the air, what explosions in the cooling lava as the
ocean checked its destructive progress! The lava rises
in mammoth blisters with numerous caves that shelter
the sheep in the autumn storms. Over all is spread a
thin mantle of lichens and within the crevices the Arctic
willow and dwarf birch are struggling to reclaim for
vegetation this awful wilderness. A wilderness it is, a
desolation, a place where witches hung their devil’s cauldrons
and brewed their fiendish potions. So intense
were their fires that their pots were ruined and when
they fled they left the curled and contorted fragments
to ensnare the feet of the orthodox traveller. The
trail winds down the sides of the cliffs and among the
towering blocks in a dizzy fashion. A portion of this
territory is called <i>Sveiflaháls</i>, Rolling Hills, that is, an
undulating mass of lava. On the right rise huge cliffs
that have been frost-shattered and at the foot of the
narrow ravines that embouche into the plain huge fans
of multi-colored rubble are spread above the crumpled
rock. From their coverts in the crevices and from
within the little caves spring the ptarmigan while the
whimbrel’s call is ceaseless from the undulating hillocks.
No grass grows here, no sheep scurry before the
traveller and not till the <i>Kaldá</i>, Cold-River, is reached
is there anything for the ponies to eat. This is a delightful
place to lunch, this grass grown mound within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the river, a tiny island in the midst of ice-cold and
sparkling water. The river itself is a natural curiosity,
as it rises in several springs from under the mountain,
like those at <i>Hlíðarendi</i>, flows merrily for two miles
and then plunges into a rift to be lost forever, unless
it has an underground passage to the sea.</p>

<p><i>Hafnarfjörðr</i> is a prosperous trading village with
a good harbor, a high school and many excellent
homes. It contains one house reported to have been
built by <i>Snorri Sturlasson</i>. As he was born in 1178
this house is of great age and worthy of a visit. It
was doubtless built as reported, for tradition in Iceland
is not like Virgil’s Fame, it is truth. The road from
this village to <i>Reykjavik</i> is of the best construction and
one must admire the skill of the engineer as the pony
canters around the curves, ascends the gentle grades
and skirts the numerous small inlets of the sea. Many
of these tiny bays indent the land, hundreds of piles of
peat are drying in the August wind, sheep and cattle are
scattered over the upland slopes, the late summer flowers
are in full bloom, the tiny fishing craft are rocking
on the shimmering sea and the wash of the water in the
lava pebbles on the strand adds music to enhance the
pleasure of this seaside ride. Out of the austerity of
the volcanic passes, into the quiet and serenity of the
uncharred meadows, comes the rider, and the load of
grandeur and sublimity is lifted that beauty and charm
may soothe the mind after the contemplation of these
natural creations that astonish and awe. This is the
pleasure road of Icelandic youth and those gentlemen
who wish to display the points of the latest saddle pony
from the great horse fairs of the north. If one has
formed the impression that Icelanders are sedate and
morose and never given to enjoyment that breeds laughter,
he should travel this road on Sunday when it is
thronged with country folk and city dwellers alike.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Gay groups are here and there, songs that are merry
from throats that are attuned fill the air, and seated
upon a jutting rock are two young people reciting to
each other in this softened light that age-old story,
that sweetest of all stories, love. This seaside drive
is to the people of <i>Reykjavik</i> what Riverside Drive is
to the people of New York City.</p>

<p>One afternoon in <i>Reykjavik</i> we entered the shop of
a fish merchant and engaged a boat with two men to
row us across the harbor to <i>Engey</i>, Meadow-Island, a
few miles from the city. The price agreed upon was
three <i>kronur</i>, about seventy-nine cents. We were absent
seven hours. The boatmen were so considerate
of our pleasure that on the return to the wharf I handed
to each a <i>krone</i>, then went to the shop of the merchant
and paid the three <i>kronur</i> as agreed. The following
afternoon this gentleman met me in the street. He
had an interpreter with him who accosted me as follows:—</p>

<p>“Are you the gentleman who engaged my boat to
go to <i>Engey</i> yesterday?”</p>

<p>I replied that I was.</p>

<p>“Did you not agree with me for three <i>kronur</i>?”</p>

<p>“I did. Did I not go to your shop on my return and
pay you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, “but on landing you gave to each
of the boatmen a <i>krone</i>, you then paid me three <i>kronur</i>.
The men left the money at the office last night. You
have overpaid me two <i>kronur</i> and I have come to return
them.”</p>

<p>With this statement he handed to me two <i>kronur</i>
which I was obliged to accept. This incident taught me
that there is one country in Europe where a man makes
a price, expects you to pay it and neither expects nor
desires any tip. Is there any other place in Europe
or in the United States in which hotel servants, railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
porters or cabmen would turn their tips over to their
employer at night? But, if such a condition can be
found, where is the hotel manager, railway official or
stable owner who would search the next day to return
a tip to the man who dared to give it? Tipping is a
violation of a contract; in Iceland contracts are inviolate.</p>

<p><i>Engey</i> is a delightful place, if one is interested in
the eider duck. They breed in thousands on this and
the neighboring island of <i>Viðey</i>, Wide-Island. The
birds are tame and will allow one to stroke their feathers
or lift them from their nests. The birds are protected
for their down which is a large item of export
from Iceland. When building their nests the birds
pluck the down from their breasts to line the nests;
when these are well lined the owner of the land robs
the nests; the birds then repluck their breasts and again
the nests are robbed. For the third time they pluck
their breasts and are not disturbed till after the eggs
hatch, when the remaining down is taken. It is interesting
to note that every crevice and every space
under a bunch of grass or the edge of the turf is occupied
with the birds. One must walk with caution so
as not to step on them. Down by the water the earliest
hatched sport in the pools while the mother sits quietly
by with one or two of the puffy balls perched upon her
back. Above, the tern, <i>Kria</i>, so named in imitation of
their cry, dart close to the nests and in a threatening
manner also at the people who intrude, uttering their
loud cries of <i>kria, kria, kria</i>.</p>

<p>Late in August we embarked in the little mail boat,
the <i>Ceres</i>, homeward bound for Copenhagen. I had
the pleasure of meeting Mr. Edward Newton of London,
a fellow traveller some years before in Labrador.
When we parted in Halifax we had never expected to
meet again. But here we were in a remote corner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the world, relating old trials and comparing notes of
our Icelandic experiences. It was a quiet Sunday evening
and many small boats hovered around the <i>Ceres</i>
to bid her farewell as she hoisted her anchor and
steamed down the glassy fiord. There were feelings of
deep regret in departing from these shores where preconceived
ideas had been so pleasantly upset by what
we had seen and felt. We were leaving an island, remarkable
for its physical characteristics, astonishing
for its contrasts, differing greatly from every other spot
on the globe. That which had chiefly attached us to
Iceland was the display of integrity and moral worth,
the high intellectual attainments and the sincere friendliness
of its people.</p>

<p class="dropcap">I visited the east coast of Iceland on two consecutive
summers. The first visit was in 1910 with
Mrs. Russell; the second trip to this realm of fog
was in 1911 as the geologist of the Stackhouse Expedition
to <i>Jan Mayen</i>. During the former year we
stopped at <i>Eskifjörðr</i>, Ash-Fiord, <i>Seyðisfjörðr</i>, Cooking-Fiord,
and <i>Vopnafjörðr</i>; during the latter visit the
Expedition spent several days in the eastern fiords especially
at <i>Faskrudsfjörðr</i>, <i>Seyðisfjörðr</i> and in the bight
of <i>Langaness</i>, Long-Cape. We were storm bound for
two days at <i>Langaness</i> and then we returned to the
south and followed the Norwegian tramp steamer <i>Ask</i>
into <i>Faskrudsfjörðr</i>. Here we recoaled, then returned
to the protection of <i>Langaness</i>, made slight repairs to
our engine and finally reached <i>Jan Mayen</i>. On our
return from the north we again entered <i>Seyðisfjörðr</i>
for coal and repairs, before putting south to <i>Faroe</i>.
These wanderings along this mountainous and fiord-cut
coast have given me ample opportunity to examine
the wonderful formations, to penetrate the fiords, climb
some of the mountains and explore the waterfall regions
as well as to observe the people engaged in fishing. The
narration in this chapter is the result of the observations
and experiences of two summers without any attempt
to give the dates.</p>

<p>Once more in Icelandic waters, this time off the east
coast. It had been a smooth run up from <i>Faroe</i>, with
a pleasant ship’s company and a placid sea. Morning
enveloped us in a fog dense as a dripping blanket. Confidently
the <i>Botnia</i> held her course with her siren sounding
every minute. At two in the afternoon the echo of
the whistle announced that we were under the lava cliffs
of Iceland, but they were invisible. The ship was stopped
but she drifted strongly with the current rushing
out of a fiord. For a long time we had heard the
whistle of a steamer and even the voices of her invisible
crew. It recalled to our minds the phantom ship of
<i>Pierre Loti</i>. Suddenly she burst into view, the <i>Scarpa</i>,
a Scotch whaler, and she ran under our starboard bow
to enquire of our skipper his position.</p>

<p>The rote of the waves upon the cliffs of <i>Krossaness</i>,
Cross-Cape, so named from the snow formations in the
cross-shaped ravines upon the mountain slopes, grew
louder. Just as many of the passengers were anxious
for their safety, we shot out of the wall of fog, like a
needle through a blanket, into clear sunshine. Behind
us the fear-breeding fog, before us the sentinel mountains
of a sunken valley whose bottom was filled with
placid water; it was <i>Reydarfjörðr</i>, Whale-Fiord. The
full glory of the glacier-carved and snow-bonneted
mountains, streaked with tumbling cascades and strips
of green sphagnum burst upon us.</p>

<p>At midnight we dropped the anchor at <i>Eskifjörðr</i>
at the time when twilight and dawn mingled their
changing colors. Such sunset glows upon snow and
multi-colored lava are seldom witnessed elsewhere. A
flush of rose-purple fell upon the cliffs and crept slowly
upward to the snow line. The sun was setting in the
north to rise in the north within the next few moments.
The livid shades poured through the mountain pass
upon the water in the free-way and streamed up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
snow-mantled lava; up, up the streamers went, deepening
the purple hues upon the reddish basalt, tinging
the icy domes with a roseate flush. The village was
asleep. Our whistle called forth the postmaster and a
few laborers, the latter to assist in exchanging a portion
of our cargo for fish, wool and eider down. We
rowed ashore and climbed the mountain at the back of
the hamlet to an elevation of 1800 feet to a large waterfall
plunging beneath a snow arch which spanned the
gorge.</p>

<p>At the border of the snow we gathered many Arctic
flowers in full bloom, among them the purple <i>Armaria</i>
and the dainty blue <i>Pinguicula</i> as well as two species
of <i>Orchids</i>. Standing on top of the snow arch, which
reverberated with the roar of the cataract beneath, we
looked over the midnight fiord. A whale was anchored
in the offing awaiting the flensing knives while over it
the gulls were wheeling in anticipation of the morning
feast; a woman was washing clothes in the brook and
below her a boy was cleaning trout; our steamer was
discharging her cargo by means of row boats, but all
else in fiord and hamlet was quiet. The long fiord
shimmered with the mingled midnight lights and the
purple-tinted spires of the mountain ranges were reflected
in these vast depths. This was Iceland’s second
greeting, an earnest of the glories we were to experience
during the coming weeks.</p>

<p><i>Eskifjörðr</i> has long been a place for the cutting up
and rendering of whales, in ancient times the Viking
ships, after their long passage from Norway, found a
haven in these eastern fiords. The place is renowned
among geologists for pure crystals of calcium carbonate,
Iceland spar, “double refracting spar.” From this
fiord thousands of pieces of this transparent crystal
have gone forth to shine in practically all of the science
laboratories of the world. The vein has been worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
since early in the seventeenth century. It is now nearly
exhausted. The best deposit was in a basalt cavity
thirty-six feet long, fifteen feet wide and ten feet high.
It is on the farm called <i>Helgustaðir</i> an hour’s ride from
the village. When discovered, the deposit filled the
cavity. Some of the crystals were three feet across and
were perfectly transparent. This is the material used
in making the celebrated Nicol’s prisms and seldom has
any spar suitable for this delicate work been found elsewhere
than in Iceland. Good deposits have recently
been located in the west of Iceland so that optical laboratories
may still be supplied with this unique and
valuable crystal. Doubtless other deposits will be
found when the lavas have been thoroughly explored.
Included crystals and pockets of crystals of various
kinds are characteristic of the Icelandic lavas.</p>

<p>The east coast of Iceland is deeply indented with
numerous fiords, each of a different formation though
the prevailing rock is pre-glacial basalt with small outcrops
of liparite and granophyre. All of the fiords
are navigable and the head of each fiord receives a
river which tumbles from the table lands in a series of
grand waterfalls. <i>Berufjörðr</i>, Naked-Fiord, in the
southeast is noted for its variegated lavas and the number
and variety of its crystals. The meteorological station
for the east coast is located here.</p>

<p><i>Faskrudsfjörðr</i>, is one of the most beautiful of the
east-coast fiords. It is a glaciated valley that rises to
an elevation of 1000 feet, in a curve like the hull of
a ship, where it meets the ragged pinnacles and summer
snows. From this line the mountains rise in serrated
ridges and frozen spires which are thrust up
through the folds of perpetual fog. This fog blanket
excludes the warmth of the sun, holding the snows
throughout the summer. As a result scores of streams
tumble down the naked gulches, leap from the precipices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and cascade over the talus into the fiord. If one stands
at the snow line on one side of the valley and looks
across to the opposite side, he may sometimes obtain a
momentary glimpse of the distant ridges when a chance
gust of wind whirls through a mountain pass and
sweeps away the fog mantle.</p>

<p>Out of the fog we came one morning into this quiet
harbor after dodging about for hours between the
basalt pillars at the entrance, those great, square piles
of lava, the clanging rookeries of the east coast, where
many a ship, more stanch than our little <i>Matador</i>, has
broken her ribs on the jutting ledges. We anchored
in midstream while the <i>Ask</i>, which had prior claim to
the single wharf, took on board her cargo of fish. This
gave the members of the <i>Jan Mayen</i> Expedition ample
time to explore the valley and climb the steep sides of
the fiord. We had twenty four hours and every hour
was spent in tramping, photographing and taking
samples of the lavas, crystals and flora.</p>

<p>This is the station of the French fishing fleet during
the spring and summer. For a long time they have had
rights in this fiord and in the adjacent waters and it is
a virtual French colony, presided over by the Abbé and
the French Consul, who is resident at <i>Reykjavik</i>. The
treaty is with Denmark as Iceland can not make a
treaty. It has been advantageous to the French but
otherwise to the local Icelandic fishermen. The younger
fishermen of Iceland have obtained power boats for
fishing off the coast and they look upon the French as
poachers upon their ancient domain and rightfully. The
French do not confine themselves to their own territory
but, like the English trawlers, poach extensively under
the sheltering folds of the fog. An Icelandic sheriff
and his deputies recently rowed out to an English trawler
that was fishing within the international limit to
expostulate with the captain. They were politely invited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
on board. The trawler steamed away and when
these innocent men came to their senses they found
themselves in a back alley of an English fishing port.
The English often go ashore to steal sheep and commit
other depredations upon the unprotected farmers of the
remote districts. This has been going on for centuries
and is the real reason why the Icelander does not love
the English. As far as I could learn the French do not
commit these acts of piracy on this shore. They maintain
a company Trading Post and compete with the
local shopmen in the village trade. The fact that the
French fishermen are Roman Catholics is distasteful to
the Icelanders, who are Lutheran, both in profession
and practice. There is a large cemetery near the mouth
of the fiord where many of the fisher folk of France for
several generations have found a rest from their tiresome
and lonely labor in the fog. How dreary it looks!
How different from the places where their relatives of
sunny France are laid away! It is simply a little enclosure
on the soilless hillside with a rude wood slab
upon which is placed a brief inscription and over all
is hung the fog, the endless, pitiless fog in which they
met their death. But what does it matter? They rest
as well in these forgotten mounds as the greater ones
of France within their marble mausoleum. The
Abbé remains during the fishing season and has charge
of a private hospital as well as an oversight of the spiritual
affairs of his people. The hospital is a blessing.
The life in the fog is lonesome, dreary, chilling, with
labor at the hand lines day and night, with constant
dread of being run down by steamers prowling through
the fog, with no change month after month, unless sickness
gives the fisherman a furlough in the hospital. It
is one long monotonous toil which induces melancholia.
<i>Pierre Loti</i> sensed the true situation and caught the
local color in his <i>Pêcheur d’Islande</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>A great fault extends across the fiord. In the bed
of a stream which flows through this ravine, the writer
found some large and exceptionally valuable zeolites.
Iceland is famed among geologists for these crystals.
I have gathered them in many places in the country,
north, east and west, but never have I found them in
such beautiful formations and of so fine a quality as
in this fiord. I also obtained excellent specimens of
chalcedony embedded in the basalt as inclusions. The
greatest find was a fossil tree, of the <i>Tertiary Period</i>,
whose diameter was five inches. During the process of
infiltration it was filled with minute crystals of zeolites
and masses of chalcedony. After supper we rowed
across the fiord, a distance of two miles to examine the
other end of this same fault and to see the fine waterfall
which comes down from the snow ravines above.
Here the rock is thickly spattered with zeolites, the
meanest of which would be a good find in other localities.
One thing vexed my English friend sorely. At
a depth of several feet in a basin of running water there
is a cavity, hemispherical in form, with a diameter of
fourteen inches, entirely lined with fine amethysts. He
desired to take it back to England and I left him gazing
at it earnestly and wondering how it could be obtained.
He decided to leave it only when I threatened
to return to the <i>Matador</i> with the boat and leave him
to walk around the head of the fiord, a distance of
ten miles.</p>

<p>At three in the morning we put to sea, bound for
<i>Jan Mayen</i>. As we left the mouth of the fiord a dense
fog, a fog so thick that our mast head light shone no
brighter than a glowworm and the forms of the forward
watch were not distinguishable from the bridge. The
captain miscalculated his position, thinking he was well
outside of the rookeries, and turned the yacht northward
into the tide rips and cross-channels that characterize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
this, the most dangerous portion of the entire
Icelandic coast. Whalebacks and skerries abound in
these waters and there are no lighthouses, no bell buoys,
no fog horns to warn the master. He must rely entirely
upon himself and take long chances. In crossing
the tide current between two of the small islands
the <i>Matador</i>, now wallowed deeply in the trough of
the wave and now rode airily upon its angry crest of
curling and running water. It was here that the
<i>Matador</i> and her little group of scientists nearly ended
their ocean voyages. The lookout was doubled. We
steamed with great caution, for the fog was thick. Suddenly
the breakers boomed all around us. We jumped
to the crest of an angry wave, growling and curling
backwards with white breakers. Sideways the yacht
slid downward into the yeasty trough. The ragged
ridge, like an apparition clothed in steel-gray garments
of shifting mists, suddenly loomed dead ahead and
under the prow.</p>

<p>“Stop,” rang the signal in the engine room.</p>

<p>“Hard-a-port,” was the sharp order to the helmsman.
Sideways we sheered from those yawning and serrated
jaws, which have crunched many a Viking sea-horse
in former days and many a fishing smack in the modern.
Would the trough of the sea well up in season for our
keel to clear that ridge? Our lives hung upon the
favorable and instantaneous answer to that question
which was in the mind of each observer of that horrid
sight. With a roar as of impending doom the waters
returned and smashed against our beam so fiercely that
everything on board was moved which was not actually
nailed down. The sleepers were tossed from their
bunks, there was a clash and clatter of pots in the
galley and a sizzle of hot steam from the upset kettles.
The faces of the few who viewed those yawning,
greedy jaws took on an ashy hue, the grayness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
pallor of the fog itself. We recovered our breath in a
long sigh of relief as the <i>Matador</i> with “full-speed-ahead”
slipped through the foaming waters into the
steady roll of the deeper sea. That was an experience
which those who participated in it never wish to repeat.</p>

<p><i>Seyðisfjörðr</i> is the most picturesque of the eastern
fiords. I have entered this fiord three times, once in
fog and twice in the full sunshine. It was one of the
earliest places visited by the Vikings and has ever since
been the resort of the fishermen on account of its excellent
harbor. The Iceland cable to Denmark by the
way of the <i>Faroe Islands</i> lands here. In old times it
was called the “Cooking Fiord,” (the name is still retained),
because of the ease with which the small craft
could run in from the sea to prepare their meals. The
outer end is marked by two fine mountains rising abruptly
from the water. The entire fiord is a recent
glacial valley and its sides are marked by prominent
raised beaches.</p>

<p>Going ashore and wandering along the single street
that skirts the upper end of the fiord, I met an Icelander
who spoke good English and we entered into a protracted
conversation about the United States. He had
formerly lived in North Dakota. During the American
war with Spain he enlisted to serve under the American
flag and was ordered to the Philippines, where he
remained till he had completed his term of enlistment.
When he received his discharge, the lure of the fatherland,
the indescribable charm of the ancient fiords was
too strong, so that, like many of his race who have
emigrated to our Northwest, he returned to the haunts
of his youth. His frugality in America had yielded
him a competence for the remainder of his life in Iceland;
the story of his wanderings in distant and tropical
lands makes him as welcome among the fishermen during
the long winters as were the scalds in the banqueting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
halls of Iceland’s ancient lords.</p>

<p>Aside from the towering mountains, precipitous and
snow-crested, and the beautiful fiord between, the fascination
of the valley lies in the upper end of the fiord
with its half-cylindrical basin and its bisecting river
roaring down its dozen waterfalls. From the extensive
moorlands of <i>Vestdalsheiði</i>, West-Dale-Heath,
flows a voluminous river, which enters the fiord in a
regular series of waterfalls of marvelous beauty. The
falls differ from each other in height of plunge and in
the rock formation and from fall to fall the river slides
down a steep gradient in an angry swirl of tossing waters.
The upper fall is the finest in the series and has
a sheer plunge of nearly a hundred feet over a perpendicular
wall of lava into a broad basin. On either side
of the valley numberless and turbulent cascades roll
downward from the melting snows of the tangled
ridges that mark the border of the great moorland
plateau. The valley is long and narrow with the river
in the very center and the river system may be likened
to the skeleton of a serpent in which the backbone is the
main stream and numerous and opposite ribs are the
tributaries. There is a point near the wharf, at an
elevation of five hundred feet above the fiord, which
one may win in half an hour, that commands a view
of the entire valley. If there is no fog this slight climb
is richly rewarded. One stands upon a jutting point of
lava at the head of one of the cascades, views the main
stream with its terraces and every silver thread that
extends from the snow line to the river. At his feet
is the fiord with its fleet of fishing smacks, down the
fiord is the open sea, the shining “swan-path” of the
<i>Sagas</i>.</p>

<p>Near by is a strong showing of copper carbonate in
the vesicula lava. All of the tubes and cavities are
lined with this beautiful green encrustation. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
opposite side of the mountain there is a similar formation
so that it is possible that there is a liberal deposit
of this useful metal in this mountain. If it is located
it will be easy to extract it as there is an abundance of
waterpower within easy access for mechanical and electrolytical
purposes.</p>

<p>One afternoon when the fog hung heavily upon fiord
and mountain, with four of my <i>Matador</i> companions
I set out to examine a glacial moraine which hangs
upon the side of <i>Bíhólsfjall</i>, upon which I had looked
with longing eye through a telescope the previous summer.
Upward we climbed and when at an elevation
of only a hundred feet above the fiord, the entire valley,
all its buildings, the fiord and its shipping disappeared
from view as if by enchantment. Many sounds
came up through the fog in a strange jumble of discordant
notes; a Norwegian tramp steamer was stowing
a cargo of clip fish, hammers clanged in the little
machine shop at our feet, so near that we could have
tossed a stone upon its roof and the clack-clack-clack
of a pony’s hoofs pacing the highway in haste to take
its rider into a refuge from the storm. The rain came
down in earnest but there was no wind. This was a
strange condition under which to climb a mountain,
whose slopes are deeply scored with crossing gullies,
where patches of moorland stretch between ridges of
talus and one may easily lose his way, but we desired
the experience and difficult as was the climb it was well
worth all the effort. If we separated from each other
three rods we were lost to view. It was uncanny, this
wandering among the gullies and carrying on a conversation
with moving and invisible beings, almost ghostly.
The fog, like fleecy blankets, hung around and rolled
over us in wisps like broad bands of cotton, so that we
literally stretched and tore it as we climbed through
it. Two of my companions clung to the brook, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
plant life was more vigorous, and it was a wise precaution
if one did not know the direction of the ravines or
the slope of the moorland. With the other two I
turned toward the southwest and we were guided by
the number of the ravines we crossed and the roar of
a waterfall on the escarpment. We traversed a boggy
area and finally reached the extensive moraine that was
formerly pushed over the cliffs by the moving ice and is
now being worked by the winter frosts and the deluge
of water descending during the summer from the melting
snows on the heights above. By the aneroid we
had climbed to an elevation of 2,000 feet above the
fiord. Here we turned and descended by the steep
stairway of columnar basalt to the valley, not once having
been out of the thick fog. Our tramp yielded considerable
profit in the examination of the debris on the
mountain side where we found excellent specimens of
water-worn liparite, that the glacier had transported
from the interior in former days. We also found fine
specimens of chalcedony geods. These were enclosed
in the pre-glacial lava, but the frost action has split the
rock and the geods are easily removed. They are about
the size of goose eggs. As we stumbled through the
darkness of the fog, unable to choose our way for more
than a rod at a time, there came to my mind that well
known passage in Isaiah,—</p>

<p>“I will bring the blind by a way that they know not;
I will lead them in paths that they have not known; I
will make darkness light before them, and crooked
things straight.”</p>

<p>During one trip up the east coast from <i>Seyðisfjörðr</i>
to the Arctic Circle we enjoyed perfect sunshine, a rare
phenomenon and worth a transatlantic voyage to witness
it. I know of no grander scenery of sea, fiord,
and mountain than this east coast. As one enters the
broad bay of <i>Vopnafjörðr</i>, under clear weather conditions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the distant glacier of <i>Vatna Jökull</i> dazzles the
eye as the sun shines upon its melting surface and is
reflected with the luster of a mirror. The extreme barrenness
of mountain and shore belies the verdure of the
quiet vales between the scattered ridges. The mountains
rise directly from the sea to a great height and the
scorched lava, the sepia-colored liparite, the ashes and
waterfalls yield wonderful shades of color. Within the
shadows of the cliffs the tiny fishing craft like great
gulls quietly await their prey.</p>

<p>On another trip over this same course, the fog closed
in upon us suddenly and unexpectedly. At first there was
a haze, a sun-streaked mist low on the water,—a moment,
and mountain, shore and sea were closed to view.
We put further out to sea to avoid the coast fog but the
wind freshened and soon a gale was blowing. We
were off <i>Langaness</i>, Long Cape, and almost on the
Arctic Circle. Sea and wind bore down so heavily
upon the little <i>Matador</i> that we were obliged to seek
the protection of the cape, not daring to round it in
the storm, and we cast anchor in <i>Eiðisvik</i>, Creek-Isthmus.
As suddenly as the fog had appeared a few
hours before, so now the Arctic Sea sprang into action
and bore down upon the cape with great violence. We
reached anchorage none too soon and there we remained
with straining cables for forty-eight hours while
the full fury of the blast blew itself to pieces. The
wind came out of the north and it was cold, the waves
ran high upon the bluffs of the <i>Ness</i> and all the sea
fowl sought the shelter of its crevices. Out at sea
a mere speck rose and fell upon the white-capped waves.
With time it grew larger and we perceived that it was a
belated dory retreating from the storm. It came
straight under our stern and we noted that it was heavily
laden with cod and rode deeply in the water. Four
red capped Faroese manned its long oars and under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
less experienced oarsmen the boat would surely have
swamped. If one wishes to observe the skill and power
of men at the oars, let him not attend a college boat
race on a quiet inland river, rather let him behold the
hardy sons of the <i>Faroe Islands</i>, inured from childhood
to the stormy waters of the north, bring their heavily
laden boat out of the tempestuous Arctic Sea and beach
it in safety on a stony shore.</p>

<p>I think that this is the most dreary spot in all Iceland.
It is as lonesome and forbidding as the uninhabited and
bleak coast of <i>Jan Mayen</i> four hundred miles to the
north. A few rods from the shore there is a small lagoon
and on the far side a few small houses, three I
believe. The people live by fishing for there is scarcely
enough grass for the few sheep and four cows that
graze at the margin of the bird-infested lagoon. The
cliffs and mountains that tower above the lagoon must
be beautiful in sunshine, but it is otherwise in storm,
and fog and Arctic storms prevail most of the time.</p>

<p>In a torrent of rain and with the wind blowing as
only the unrestricted winds of the Polar Ocean can
blow, five of us ventured to lower a boat and row
ashore to beach it where we had observed that the <i>Faroese</i>
had done the same the previous night. The entire
beach is littered with drift wood consisting of bits of
bark, branches and heavy timber. All of the material
that I examined proved to be larch. A few trees bore
the marks of the axe, but most of them had been torn
up by the roots in some great river freshet and had
been swept out to sea, probably from the great rivers
of Siberia, the Lena, Obi, Kolyma and Yenisei. As I
write I have before me a thick piece of bark from a
Siberian larch that I picked up on this shore. What a
voyage it has made! Whence came it and how long
was its unlogged voyage? It is not in imagination that
we scan its record. Though not in figures stating latitudes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and longitudes and not in characters of ink, yet
its great Polar voyage is clearly revealed to him who
knows the currents of the north, the prevailing winds
and the drift of the ice floes. This bit of bark passed
out to sea during the spring floods that make such havoc
in the Siberian forests; it became embedded in the ice,
as did Nansen’s <i>Fram</i>. Slowly it drifted with the
pack, now backwards under the pressure of the wind,
now lifted in a great pressure ridge as two opposing
packs met; now under the influence of wind and current
it made progress and, again like the <i>Fram</i>, was
liberated from the ice west of Spitzbergen and drifted
southward to find lodgement on this bleak cape. Fifty
miles away, on <i>Rauðagnúpa</i>, Red-Peak, in 1905 was
picked up the Bryant-Melville cask, which had been
placed on the pack ice north of Point Barrow in 1899.
The elapsed time from the placing of this cask on the
ice by Captain D. N. Tilton of the American whaler,
<i>Alexander</i>, to the date of its discovery by the Icelandic
farmer, Vigfus Benidiktsson, was five years, eight
months and fourteen days. We have not the space in
which to discuss the Great Polar Current but we can
assert that this piece of larch bark, yes, and the thousands
of larch trees, that come to land on the north
coast of Iceland and in Driftwood Bay in <i>Jan Mayen</i>,
have journeyed over or near the North Pole. The
wood is a boon to the Icelanders as it is used for fuel
and in the construction of their houses.</p>

<p>On the beach I found a mass of spermacetti weighing
over two hundred pounds that had been cast up by
the sea. I also gathered many pumice fragments, worn
by abrasion into balls and egg-shaped masses. The
character of this pumice shows that it came from the
great eruption of <i>Askja</i>, Bowl, one hundred and twenty-five
miles away. It was probably blown into the eastern
<i>Jökullsá</i>, Ice-Mountain-River, floated out to sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and was then driven north by wind and current to this
shore. Among all the flotsam on this stormy shore the
strangest was a find of tropical plants that had drifted
with the Gulf Stream past the north of Norway, thence
eastward to Nova Zembla, then north and west towards
Franz Josef Land and then west towards Spitzbergen
where it was liberated and came down with the Polar
drift from the Siberian forests as above mentioned.
Here the Tropics and the Arctic meet on the Arctic
Circle.</p>

<p>We shot many birds on the shore for museum specimens
and enough for an ample feast for our entire
party. We came on board again after several hours of
tramping in the driving rain and in a temperature close
to the freezing point. It was a fine experience and we
ran no risk save in beaching and launching of our little
boat. When we had changed our clothing and had
partaken of a hot meal we felt amply repaid for the
exertion as the examination of the drift material on
the shore was well worth while.</p>

<p>I quote from my journal of 1911.</p>

<p>“It is midnight. The wind is blowing a full gale
which is periodically accented by gusts of higher velocity.
The <i>Matador</i> is straining at her cable in an alarming
manner. The rigging creaks and groans as the
boat rolls in the blast. The sea is running high, the
rain descends in torrents and the spray from the crests
of the waves is driving over us in sheets and slashes
against the windows of the tiny deck cabin. On the
shore, where we landed this noon the breakers are rolling
heavily and we can hear the rumble and grinding
of the rocks as the water rushes back into the sea. If
our cable parts we must be driven onto the shore. The
Baron<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> has come on deck to bid me good night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is rough outside the Ness tonight, judging by
what we are getting in here,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“We may be thankful that we are snug here and not
being driven before the gale out there,” he replied.
“Many a ship has gone down to Davy Jones’ Locker
off that point in just such weather as this. Do you
know that the <i>Fridtjof</i> lies at the bottom of the Ness?”</p>

<p>“What of the <i>Fridtjof</i>, Baron?”</p>

<p>“She was the vessel in which I went to the Antarctic
in 1903 to rescue Nordenskiöld. He had been rescued
by the Argentine Frigate, <i>Urugua</i>, a few days before
our arrival and we got back to Stockholm in April
1904. The <i>Fridtjof</i> took us through the Antarctic ice
pack and brought us safely home and now she lies out
there on those submarine lava crags. In spite of the
roughness of our present position, we may well be
thankful that the <i>Matador</i> has her anchor well gripped
to the bottom of this little shelter. Good night.”</p>

<p>On our first visit to the east coast of Iceland we
left <i>Vopnafjörðr</i> early in the morning, with beautiful
weather and a placid sea. The water was unrippled
save where the guillemots and puffins dived as the
steamer approached. It was so warm that we lounged
on the deck under an awning and thoroughly enjoyed
the novelty of the first crossing of the Arctic Circle.
There was nothing to suggest the severity of the north
in this warm sunshine with no wind and certainly no
ice. <i>Langaness</i> loomed high on our port and over the
black bluffs countless birds were hovering in a querulous
mood. How different was this experience from
that of a year later in the same locality when the
<i>Matador</i> was struggling to reach <i>Jan Mayen</i>!</p>

<p>In the afternoon we anchored in the open waters off
<i>Húsavik</i> and rowed ashore for a few enjoyable hours
while the <i>Botnia</i> was taking on board bundles of wool
and bales of fish. <i>Húsavik</i>, House-by-the-Creek, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
place where the first known house in Iceland was built.
Here it was that Gardar, the Swede, who first circumnavigated
Iceland in 864, spent the winter. The village
is a thriving trading station, the outlet for large
quantities of wool and fish, skins and feathers collected
here from a wide region. Pack trains arrive daily in
the summer from the interior and the ponies, laden with
big sacks, present a pretty picture as they wind down
the mountain side into the village. The departure of
the pack train is even more picturesque, as the ponies
are buried under bundles of every conceivable shape;
provisions, mostly rye, sugar and coffee, farming tools,
furniture and lumber, the latter fastened by one end
to the saddle while the other end drags on the ground.
The Icelandic farmer is a past master in the art of
loading a pony. In former days large quantities of
refined sulfur from the <i>Mývatn</i> region were taken to
this port on the backs of the ponies. There remain
thousands of tons of good sulfur for the coming of
capital and energy backed with business acumen.</p>

<p>Near <i>Húsavik</i> on the shore of <i>Skálfandi Bay</i>, Trembling,
there is a geological formation unique in Iceland.
It is a small area of old <i>Pliocene</i> crag, containing fossil
shells, mostly the <i>Venus Icelandica</i>, embedded in clay,
sand and marl. Some of the shells are filled with
calcarious crystals. <a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>The <i>Pliocene</i> is the most recent
portion of the <i>Tertiary Age</i>, geologically speaking, and
in a country so completely volcanic as is Iceland, this
corner is of great interest to geologists as it helps to
fix the age of the basalts relatively. This <i>Pliocene</i> section
is practically the only section found in the country,
though mention has been made above of a <i>Tertiary</i> tree
fossil which I found in <i>Faskrudsfjörðr</i>. There is some
lignite in this deposit and a thorough examination of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the marls will yield further data for an interesting discussion.
Lignite has been found in a few other portions
of the country. On the slender strength of this evidence,
during the summer of 1910 two Englishmen who
presented engraved cards as civil and mining engineers,
coal experts and a few other specialties, traversed a
large portion of Iceland looking for a coal deposit. I
met them on three different occasions and they were
still looking for coal. There is no better country in the
world in which to “look” for coal than Iceland for
one may transmit this pastime to his children with no
fear that his offspring will ever lack an occupation. The
fierce volcanic fires that have raged in the bowels of this
country and seared and blistered its surface would have
effectually destroyed this substance had it ever existed.
One might as well search for tinsel in a furnace as for
coal in Iceland.</p>

<p>We visited the new church to examine the fine old
altar piece, painted on wood over three hundred years
ago. It is in an excellent state of preservation and the
people are justly proud of this relic. Beside the road
in front of the church there is an alms box on a post.
Beside it hangs the key on a nail. There is a request
in English, German, French and Icelandic for contributions
for the benefit of the widows and orphans of those
who have lost their lives at sea. We wondered if an
alms box with its key in a similar position would be a
profitable arrangement for charity in America or in any
other country of Europe. This is another evidence of
the honesty and integrity of the native.</p>

<p>There came on board the <i>Botnia</i> at <i>Húsavik</i> three
gentlemen with whom I was to associate a good deal
during the coming year on the <i>Matador</i>, Walter Friedeberg,
F. R. G. S., of Berlin, Baron Axel Klinckowström
and his son Harald of Stockholm, Sweden. They were
bound for <i>Mývatn</i> to collect birds for the Museums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of Berlin and Upsala. The Baron proved to be a
rare entertainer, he speaks several languages with fluency,
he is a man of profound learning, a scientist with
several volumes in Swedish and German to the credit
of his versatile pen. He has travelled from Spitzbergen
to the Antarctic, associated with some of the best known
explorers and scientists. He had many an anecdote
with which to entertain the company.</p>

<p>Late in the evening we steamed across the bay
towards <i>Akureyri</i>, Corn-Land. At midnight we passed
close to the coast beyond <i>Flatey</i>, Flat-Island, and the
atmosphere was so clear that we had perfect views of
the old craters along the shore. There are four of
them and their rims coincide. The half of the craters
next to the ocean has been blown out so that they present
the appearance of four huge clam shells standing
on edge with the concave sides towards the observer.
The interiors are scorched and blistered and give a suggestion
of the fierce fires that once raged within these
walls. We passed up the <i>Eyjaförðr</i>, Island-Fiord, the
longest and finest of the many fiords in Iceland, and at
five in the morning, long ere the town awoke, we tied up
to the little wharf in <i>Akureyri</i>. Our sea journey was at
an end. Our guide and ponies having arrived from
<i>Reykjavik</i> the night before, we left the comfortable
steamer without regret to spend a month with the ponies,
to explore new regions, to enjoy the meadows, moors
and mountains of a marvellous land.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Ólafur Eyvindsson had crossed the
country from <i>Reykjavik</i> by way of the western
dales with a train of eight ponies. The
packing boxes, saddles and provisions had
been forwarded by the coast steamer, so that when we
landed from the <i>Botnia</i>, thanks to the faithfulness of
Helgi Zoëga, everything was in readiness for our departure.
At one in the afternoon we entered a launch
and crossed the broad <i>Eyjarförðr</i>. On the beach we
found a farmer with ponies saddled and waiting for
our departure to <i>Mývatn</i>, Midge-Lake. Ólafur had
taken the precaution to drive the ponies around the
upper end of the fiord and across the marshes at low
tide the previous evening for pasturage as grass is
scarce in <i>Akureyri</i> and the charges are excessive.</p>

<p>We left the bulk of our provisions at the house of
the farmer, since we would not require them in the region
we were about to visit and it was necessary to
return to <i>Akureyri</i> to set out upon our long journey
across the country. We ascended the bluff and turned
northwards to climb the mountain along a diagonal.</p>

<p>Once more in the saddle, with the length of the summer
and the width of Iceland between us and the steamer
that would bear us from <i>Reykjavik</i> to Denmark. Our
trip up the east coast and the stops at the trading posts
had been pleasant and full of interest but the real work,
and the enjoyment that is born of it, was before us. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
was with a spirit of exultation that we turned the ponies
into the narrow trail that winds up the mountain side
and, after a year of absence, felt the motion of our little
steeds. Step by step we climbed the gradient; little by
little the fiord below narrowed and lengthened; the
sounds of the fishermen and the bustle of the shipping
diminished and finally disappeared altogether. The
mountain rose in a wild tumble of treeless ridges and
ice-crowned escarpments, scored with shining glaciers
and coursed by numberless waterfalls and trickling rivulets
that resolved the great silence into a musical cadence.
We “knew the land of smiling face,” we understood
from experience that there were bridgeless and troublesome
rivers to cross, morasses to negotiate or in which
to founder, smoking solfataras and trackless wastes of
lava, deserts of sand and glacial moraines to cross between
the northern and southern coasts. But the spell
of Viking Land was upon us and we realized that for
the summer it was all our own,—free to anyone who
would take the trouble to explore,—to roam when and
where we willed, unfettered by time tables, with no
porters, cabbies nor waiters to break the spell, no fences
to obstruct, no “trespass forbidden” to turn us aside, no
man to say us nay. The roar of the locomotive and the
purr of the motor had been left far behind as also the
jostling of ubiquitous tourists with their satellites the
guides. A day of delight in the saddle was to be followed
each day by a better one: an evening welcome at a
humble farm and a heartfelt God-speed in the morning.
Our only limitation, the ponies. These promised well
at the start. They had been carefully chosen and at
the end of the long and difficult journey proved their
worth.</p>

<p>The ascent of <i>Vaðlaheiði</i>, Wade-Heath, in sunshine
is one of the best rides in Iceland. The long fiord
opens out to the Arctic Ocean at our feet and the distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
<i>Jökulls</i> rise into prominence with diadems of ice
upon their brows. The pastures on the lower slopes
stud the valley with gems of emerald. Nearing the
summit we came upon the unmelted snows of winter,
which were crusted sufficiently to support the horses.
Here we found a company of men laboriously dragging
telephone poles to the summit to repair the damage
of the winter storms. At an elevation of 2,300
feet above the fiord we reached a flat moorland which
slopes gently, at first, towards the east. We paused to
bait the ponies and stretched ourselves at length on a
mound of Arctic flowers and gazed across the valley
to the <i>Vindheima Jökull</i>, Home of the Winds.</p>

<p>We followed a zigzag line of cairns down towards
the valley of the <i>Fnjóská</i>, Touch-Wood-River. The
view of this valley with the broad, swift river flowing
in a long series of S-curves, the enormous mounds of
volcanic ash fantastically sculptured by the wind, the
little farm by the river where we refreshed ourselves
with real cream and the forest of diminutive birch on
the opposite bank of the river, these will never be forgotten.
To one accustomed to seeing the joyous meadows
of Iceland in undulating reaches of emerald green
sprinkled with brilliant flowers, the tangled heaths of
the uplands where roam uncounted sheep and half-wild
ponies and the barren slopes of the foot hills of the volcanic
ranges, as viewed from any descending trail,—this
prospect is extremely pleasing. It must be remembered
that there are no real forests in Iceland. Henderson,
writing in 1817, says,—</p>

<p>“About a hundred years ago the valley exhibited one
of the finest forests in Iceland, but now there is not a
single tree to be seen,—such has been the havoc made
by the inclemency of the seasons and the improvident
conduct of the inhabitants. The remains of this forest
are still visible on the east side of the river, which divides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the valley, in the numerous stumps of birch trees
which present themselves, some of which exceed two
feet in diameter.”</p>

<p>That there were large forests in the ancient days we
have plenty of evidence in the numerous references in
the <i>Sagas</i>. In the thirty-sixth chapter of <i>Burnt Njál</i>
we read:—</p>

<p>“There was a man named Swart, Bergthora’s house-carle.
Now Bergthora told him that he must go up
into Redslip and hew wood; I will get men to draw
home the wood.”</p>

<p>There is further evidence that the wood was large
enough so that it was hewn for ship-building and for
houses. Since Henderson’s day, the <i>Fnjóská</i> forest has
sprouted and grown to a considerable size. The trees
are four to eight feet high and mostly of birch. There
are several of these birch forests in Iceland and the
government not only protects them but provides a
trained forester to study the local problems of forestation.
Though not large enough for timber yet the birch
has a definite value for the people. The branches and
brush are used to lay between the layers of fuel while
drying and the larger pieces are used to make plaiting on
the roofs over which turf is laid. The tough birch also
lends itself well to the making of rakes and other implements
upon the farm.</p>

<p>Until quite recently the passage of the <i>Fnjóská</i>
was most difficult and we were agreeably surprised to
find a reinforced concrete bridge spanning the flood.
What a task was its construction! The cement and steel
had to be transported over the mountain by the ponies
from <i>Akureyri</i> but a great mistake was made in its
width. It is suitable for horseback crossing but will
not permit the passage of even a two-wheel cart of short
axle, such as is being introduced upon some of the farms.
The building of these bridges is doing much to bring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
remote farms into closer relationship.</p>

<p>Crossing a waste of wind-driven sand and ashes we
arrived at the parsonage of <i>Háls</i>, Ridge, a farm of
great antiquity. For many centuries it has been the
resting place for travellers across the mountains from
<i>Akureyri</i> to the east. Even in <i>Saga</i> days, when farers
from over the seas drew up their ships in the fiord for
the winter and journeyed eastward for “guesting” they
made use of this place for refreshment. We did not
call as we hoped to reach another farm at the far end
of the lake by evening.</p>

<p>The descent of the ridge into the upper end of the
valley is pleasing because of the varied scenery. At
the foot of the hill we crossed a bog and forded a small
stream; the bog was difficult on account of recent rain
and the ponies moved with greatest caution. When we
reached solid ground we halted to graze the ponies and
to examine the rich flora of the locality. As we mounted
a party of Englishmen whirled by at a furious gallop.
This gave us some concern as we knew that the farm
towards which we were making our way had accommodations
for only one party and it looked as if they intended
to be the party. We learned later that they
turned towards the north in search of a coal deposit,
which it is needless to say they did not find.</p>

<p><i>Ljósavatnsskarð</i>, Lake-of-Light-Pass, is a narrow
valley, a watershed. The stream that tumbles down
the gorge from the mountains divides into two arms,
one flows eastward into the lake and the other westward
into the <i>Fnjóská</i>. The ride down towards the
lake is one continual crossing of small streams that rush
down the snow gullies. From the pass to the margin of
the lake we crossed, by actual count, fifty-three of these
white streams during a ride of two hours.</p>

<p><i>Ljósavatn</i>, Lake-of-Light, will ever remain one of
the brightest memory pictures of Icelandic scenery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
The lake is long and narrow, the mountains descend
abruptly on either side. The tumbling cascades, the
many sheep upon the green ridges between the cataracts,
the cattle grazing eye-deep in the lush grass along the
shore, the numerous water fowl, where many a</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Stately drake, led forth his fleet upon the lake,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the spectrum colors in the lava cliffs, the bands of cloud
that hang perpetually over the narrow notch,—with
clouds, colors, waterfalls and crags mirrored in the
burnished surface,—formed a picture framed in the
dark outlines of the mountains that caused us to dismount
and for an hour held our close attention.</p>

<p>At evening we reached the <i>Djúpá</i>, Deep-River, well
named. This stream has carved a gorge through a mass
of old craters and heaps of volcanic ash. Under the
influence of several days of continual sunshine the snows
had been rapidly melting. We spent an hour in a fruitless
search for a suitable ford and then drove the pack
ponies into the torrent to swim across and composed
ourselves for a good wetting in the icy water. We drew
our knees above the necks of the ponies, seized the
crupper strap with the left hand, turned the ponies up
stream and made the crossing without serious mishap.
A portion of the way the ponies were obliged to swim
and the rapid current carried them far down stream.
Thanks to the sagacity of the little fellows and to their
perseverance, we escaped without getting wet, although
our precarious position, balanced as we were on the
top of the saddles, promised to topple us into the angry
waters. The pack horses swam the stream with the
packing cases partly submerged. Within an hour we
were made comfortable in the tidy farmhouse at
<i>Ljósavatn</i> and the contents of the cases were spread
in the kitchen to dry. The house is large and comfortable
and two beds were prepared for us upstairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
an unusual condition as the guest room is usually on
the ground floor. We had only one inconvenience,—the
telephone is located in the guest chamber. Beside
the house there is a small church where the farmers
and their families assemble on Sunday, some of them
from a considerable distance.</p>

<p>On the Sabbath all work ceases in Iceland, unless approaching
rain makes it imperative that the cured hay
be taken to the stacks. The people array themselves
in their best attire and ride to church at a wild gallop,
each on his favorite pony. The small children ride
with their parents and the young people from the different
farms so time their journey as to meet at the intersecting
bridle paths and relate the news of the past
week. On they ride, an ever increasing cavalcade, over
moor and mountain ridge, across brook and farm till
the parish has assembled at the church. The ponies
are hobbled or turned into a compound and their riders
have an hour for gossip before the service begins. The
aged sit upon the grass and exchange snuff—a universal
custom in Iceland,—and eagerly report the gossip that
has filtered to the distant farms from the coast. The
young meet in the church yard and many a pledge is
here given that binds them together till the turf of the
same yard receives beneath its floral decorations one
of the faithful pair. The women hasten to the parsonage
to don their best gown and arrange their braids and
the silk tassel of the <i>húfa</i>, woman’s cap. Finally arrives
the pastor at the church, who greets all the people
individually, arrays himself in his accustomed robes
and then with the ringing of the bell the service begins.
The sermon is generally read from manuscript, after
which the Holy Communion is celebrated frequently followed
by a christening. The service ended, the people
usually assemble at a near-by house for coffee and
further conversation after which the parties go their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
several ways. The young men attempt to show the
speed of their ponies in short spurts that would do
credit to a western cow-boy, each trying to outstrip the
other. The maidens follow demurely and the old people
ride away last of all in a quiet manner. How well they
know from experience that as soon as their sons are out
of sight that they will rein down those galloping steeds
and hold them until the maidens overtake them. Then
Sigurð and Karin, side by side, will wend their leisurely
way to Karin’s home just like the young couples of
other lands. The merry greetings and the cheerful partings
at the church yard have ceased to fill the air and
only the wind stirs the long grass upon the roof and
sways the flowers upon the graves.</p>

<p>No pack trains come and go, no hay-laden ponies
wind up from the meadows, no scythe rings with the
stone,—the sounds of farm-life are hushed and the peace
of the well-kept Sabbath rests upon these homes. Sunday
evening calls are made and long ones they are, coffee
is served with delicious cakes, the snuff horn circulates
freely and in the compound the saddled ponies patiently
await the coming of their masters for the wild ride
over the moors to their own pastures.</p>

<p>I have witnessed many Sundays in Iceland and each
one impressed me with the peace and happiness of its
people, the devotion of worship and the value of the
plain and simple life as a factor in contentment. To
the young men who enquired about the customs of America
and its advantages I had little to offer and my advice
was to stay where the customs of centuries had ingrained
habits of simplicity and instilled contentment. After
all, what more do we wish in this world than contentment?
Given enough to eat and to wear, protecting
shelters, books and an occupation, the influence of right
living and an absence of the craving for money and position,
and man may be truly happy,—no matter under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
what sky his tent is pitched. In <i>Reykjavik</i> with its
sprinkling of foreign merchants and its few people who
ape the customs of the continent in dress and in vice,
yes and in idleness the mother of most of the vices, conditions
are different. As in America, so in Iceland, the
boy, who leaves the paternal roof and the occupation of
his ancestors, who scorns the opportunities of the farm
and seeks his fortune in the metropolis, soon puts aside
his home-taught virtues, lapses into ways of idleness,
acquires the idea that the world owes him the same living
as that won by the ceaseless energy of toil, and it is
not long before he becomes a derelict upon the ocean of
humanity.</p>

<p>At breakfast we were treated for the first time in
our Icelandic experience to the national dish of skyr,
curdled milk. My first experience was not pleasant but
I have since learned to relish it. It was necessary to
eat a goodly portion of it in order not to offend the
mistress who had taken considerable trouble to prepare
it for us in the best fashion. <i>Skyr</i> has been a national
dish from the earliest days of the <i>Vikings</i> but the
method of its preparation has been kept secret. On
our second return from Iceland we were accompanied
by an Icelandic maid, who frequently prepared for our
table Icelandic dishes, but we could never persuade her
to prepare this dish nor to tell us how it was made.
Another dish set before us was cheese made of sheep’s
milk; it was nearly chocolate in color and resembled mild
roquefort in flavor. I needed no repeated trials to acquire
a taste for this delicacy. It was set before us at
every farm but it varied a good deal in quality. If one
does not relish a rich, full-flavored cheese then the
Icelandic cheese of sheep’s milk would not appeal to his
taste.</p>

<p>The country around <i>Ljósavatn</i> is of considerable
geological interest. The lake is of glacial origin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
around it are several small drumlins of ashes and rubble
which are now being transformed into conglomerate.
The lake has the form of the Scottish inland <i>lochs</i> and
was formed by the filling in of one end of a glacial valley
with glacial debris. Since the formation of the lake
there has been a lava outflow across the east end of the
valley and scores of small craters are along the banks
of the <i>Djúpá</i>.</p>

<p>An hour’s ride from the farm across the ancient lava
bed brings the traveller to the bridge across the <i>Skjálfandafljót</i>,
Trembling River, and to the <i>Goðafoss</i>,
Falls-of-the-Gods, one of the most beautiful waterfalls
in Iceland. It has not the grandeur of the <i>Gullfoss</i> and
the <i>Dettifoss</i> but its symmetrical formation and the two
even sheets of water that pour over its brink unbroken
make it very attractive. In form it is like Niagara, and
<i>like</i> Niagara has its rocky island near the middle. The
eastern fall is about seven feet lower than the western,
due to the lava formation over which the water flows.
The falls are between twenty-five and thirty feet in
height according to the melting of the snows. The
rocky islet is split asunder and a solid stream of water
pours through the cleft forming a central fall. The
spray and mist from the falls are visible for many miles
around and to one accustomed to look for hot springs,
whenever mists are seen rising in a column from the
plain, this waterfall comes as a great surprise when
one approaches the unexpected canyon.</p>

<p>All the country side is historic land and is frequently
mentioned in the <i>Sagas</i>. When we left the river valley
and climbed to the summit of the tableland and were
skirting the great bog, we recalled that it was related
in the <i>Saga</i> of <i>Hrafnkell</i>, <i>Frey’s Priest</i>, how <i>Sámr</i> with
three ponies rode from <i>Mývatn</i> across <i>Fljótsheiði</i>,
River-Heath, to <i>Ljósavatn</i> Pass and on to the great
fiord. We were taking the same journey but in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
opposite direction. The great heath on the upland is
typical of the highland heaths of Iceland and may be
briefly described in this connection.</p>

<p>It is a tongue of land some thirty miles long, reaching
down from the inland plateau between two great
river valleys. When the summit is gained it appears
quite flat but a place where one would little expect to
find extensive bogs and marshes, but such is the case.
We followed the bog at its margin for nearly two hours
in search of a place to cross and noted that patches of
water glimmered here and there. Beautiful Arctic
flowers fringed the margin of the pools, masses of
<i>Eriophorum</i>, Cotton-Grass, spread their white sheets
in the sun and the dwarf birch and Arctic willow tangled
every foot of the way. Scores of ancient bridle
trails cut into the ground so deeply that in places the
ponies rubbed their sides against the turf in following
them. Numerous sheep were scattered about the moorland
singly and in groups of three to a dozen. Often
a sheep would get into the trail and run in front of
the ponies for half an hour bleating in a frightened
manner. This custom of making a needless run until
exhausted and driven far from their companions speaks
strongly for the small intelligence of these domestic
animals. The sheep run wild upon the mountain pastures
and moors throughout the summer and are characteristic
features of the landscape.</p>

<p>At the narrow neck of glacial moraine where we
crossed the great bog we halted for an hour for lunch
and to graze the ponies and shift the saddles. These
out of door luncheons are real picnics. One turns up
the lid of a packing case for a table, seats himself upon
the grass and finds more enjoyment in the repast than
at the best spread board in a fashionable hotel. The
plover and whimbrel are always about to add their
joyous cries to the calling of the curious sheep, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
ponies graze contentedly around the outer circle of the
luncheon board and over all is the deep blue vault and
showers of glorious sunshine. Those hours of rest and
refreshment upon the heather and the enjoyment of the
pipe! We were veritable Arabs, our steeds the thoroughbred
Icelandic ponies and our oasis the patch of
grass in the midst of a great lava desolation. There
are no palm trees beside the water hole to complete the
Oriental scene but a pillar of lava shelters one from
the wind, or, if the day be sultry, one may crawl beneath
a scrub of Arctic willow to ward off the sun and
it is then, if the flies are present, that the pipe is a
double comfort.</p>

<p>In the middle of the afternoon as we were descending
a ridge into a gully with a boggy brook to cross we
heard a shout from the top of the ridge, “Turn to the
left, the crossing is better.” Looking back we saw a
party of several Icelanders galloping down the slope,
led by a portly gentleman with a smiling countenance.
We paused till he approached and were surprised to
have him address us by name and add that he expected
us to spend the night at his home. It was <i>Árni Jónsson</i>
of <i>Skútustaðir</i>, Cave-Stead, the Dean of <i>Mývatn</i>, accompanied
by his wife and three friends. They
had just come from <i>Akureyri</i>, having stopped at
the parsonage of <i>Háls</i> while we had been at
<i>Ljósavatn</i>. From this moment until we reached
his farm the ride was most enjoyable on account of
the companionship of the Dean. Several years of his
early life had been passed in North Dakota and he
was well acquainted with the customs of the United
States. He spoke English with fluency and had many
questions to ask about America. We were glad to give
him the information in return for the many questions
we found necessary to ask him about Iceland and the
customs of his people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>With sixteen ponies we made a merry showing as
eight of us rode in single file at a full gallop over the
undulating moor, now rising to the top of a ridge with
a broad view of the country bordering the lake we
were approaching, now descending into a gully rich in
grass where we made the customary halt to rest the
ponies. Towards evening we rode down to the <i>Kráká</i>,
Crow-River, which we forded and soon afterwards arrived
at the farm of the Dean. We were ushered into
the sitting room, a separate room was provided for our
luggage and we were given a large room over the
<i>Thinghús</i> adjoining. The <i>Thinghús</i> in each <i>Syssel</i>,
County, corresponds to the Court House in our Counties.</p>

<p>The children followed us about with some curiosity
and were especially interested in our toilet preparations.
They were excellently behaved and watched
every chance to be of assistance. We enjoyed an excellent
supper and that which made it especially agreeable
was the fact that the Dean’s wife dined with us.
This is a rare occurrence for strangers in Iceland. After
supper we sat for a long time listening to the Dean’s
account of his people. He was very obliging and afforded
us much information relative to the conditions
of the church, Icelandic politics, woman suffrage and
education.</p>

<p>Weary with the eight hours in the saddle, Mrs.
Russell retired while I roamed about the farm till midnight,
examining the strange lava formations. Midnight?
Yes, but bright as day and under a cloudless
sky. When one is interested in the north of Iceland,
he does not know when to go to bed. At the end of
my long ramble I expected to find Mrs. Russell asleep,
on the contrary she was sitting up in bed admiring the
needlework on the sheets and pillow cases. The upper
sheet had a hand crocheted insertion in Icelandic, <i>Goða<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Nott, Sof ðu Rott</i>, Good Night, Sleep Softly. One of
the pillow slips was marked in the same fashion, <i>Goða
Nott, Pabbi</i>, Good Night, Papa. The other was
marked, with the similar Icelandic expression for Good
Night, Mamma. We admired the skillful needlework
and the amount of time and patience necessary to complete
this remarkable set and admitted that the Dean’s
wife possessed considerable skill, even among Icelandic
women where the art of hand embroidery is far advanced.
When we commented upon it, Mr. Jónsson,
with a smile, called to him his little daughter of twelve
and said,—</p>

<p>“This is the little lady who did that needle work.
She did it while in the fields last summer and without
our knowing anything about it. It was her Christmas
present to father and mother.”</p>

<p>Several days later as we were packing the cases preparatory
to our departure, this little girl approached
and shyly presented to Mrs. Russell a package. Not
knowing the contents it was accepted with the customary
handshaking. When a chance moment offered it was
slyly opened and lo! it was one of those pillow cases.
We then protested against receiving so valuable a gift
and one that had been devoted to a parent with a child’s
love at Christmas time. Mr. Jónsson assured us that his
daughter was sincere in her wish that we should take it
home to the United States and that she would be
happy to make another to complete the set. This pillow
case, covering a pillow of genuine eider down, has
since held a place of honor in our guest room and we
never see it without recalling the bright faces and the
hearty hospitality of <i>Skútustaðir</i>.</p>

<p>At eight in the morning I awoke and was scarcely
out of bed when the door opened and in came the maid,
Kristine, with coffee, sugar, cream and cakes for our
first meal. I tried to have her leave it outside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
door and motioned her away but it was of no use. In
she came with the air of one who knew her duty to
her master’s guests and intended to fulfill it. She
placed the tray on a stand, turned quickly to our clothes,
gathered them up and was about to take them away
when I protested as vigorously as I could with signs
that they were necessary for my immediate use, but to
no effect. I did succeed in pulling from her grasp my
trousers but she fled smilingly with all the other items
of wearing apparel even to the hats and riding boots.
We were prisoners. After the coffee had been drunk
the maid returned with the clothes nicely brushed and
folded and the boots polished. Ever after this I slept
with my trousers under my pillow and my extra pair
of shoes hid in the room; otherwise I would have often
been deprived of an hour of delightful strolling about
the farm before the real breakfast.</p>

Cottage in the Distance.</i></p>
<p class="caption"><i>Contorted, Twisted and Crumpled Lava at Skútustaðir.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Mývatn</i> region is the most fascinating, the most
weird as well as the most beautiful place in all Iceland.
I believe it to be the fairest spot in all that land of sun-kissed
and wind-swept enchantment. The lake is
twenty miles long and its deepest place is not over
twelve feet. There are places where the water is hot
and others where the water flows from under the lava
in ice-cold streams into the lake. At the entrance of
these streams there is excellent trout fishing. The lake
is dotted with islands, each a small crater, each fringed
to the edge of the water with the fragrant <i>Angelica</i>,
each clothed with grass nearly to the summit and each
summit black and red, scorched, blistered and horrent.
Hundreds of these low craters fringe the southern end
of the lake and are scattered over the adjoining farms,
especially the farm of <i>Skútustaðir</i>. They are an exact
representation of the mountains of the moon as viewed
through a powerful telescope. To the geologist the
<i>Mývatn</i> craters are of rare interest, for nowhere else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
on the earth are they duplicated in the numbers and
in their peculiar formation. They rest like huge ant
hills on a level plain, each is circular in form and many
of them are confluent at the base. The slopes of many
of the mounds are covered with bombs and of characteristic
type. The character of the bombs on the slopes
of widely separated craters is different, indicating a different
period of eruption and a different composition
of lava which entered into their formation.</p>

<p>One of the craters deserves a special description. It
is shaped like an inverted funnel with the stem cut off at
the apex of the funnel. Out of this orifice the lava was
hurled in liquid drops to so great a height in the
air that it cooled and the bombs returned to the
crater and around it like a shower of grape-shot. It
must have been a wonderful sight, the spraying of the
upper air with liquid lava like water from a hose and
to such an altitude that the stream broke into drops
and every drop cooled before it returned to earth. A
few of the bombs are fused together because they
collided in a viscid condition. Others are flattened because
the mass struck the earth before they had become
rigid; but most of them are spherical and vary
in size from tiny pellets to a croquet ball.</p>

<p>There are several <i>tintrons</i> around <i>Mývatn</i> and in
the adjacent region of <i>Húsavik</i>. A <i>tintron</i> is a hornito,
or more correctly speaking, a lava chimney. A hornito
is a veritable lava oven from which issues smoke and
fumes and it may be level or even sunk below the level
of the general surface of the lava sheet; while a
<i>tintron</i>, like a factory chimney with a spreading base,
rises from the level ground to the height of many feet.
It is evident from examination that they were formed by
the spouting of lava in a liquid state so hot as to have
lost its viscousness, and, like geyser-formations, that
which fell upon the rim cooled and continual spoutings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
built the <i>tintron</i>. We ascended one of the <i>tintrons</i> beside
the lake and gazed down into its black depths.
The outer surface at the base is clothed with grass
while the <i>tintron</i> proper is encrusted with lichens.
What a rugged and forbidding aspect is presented in
the interior! Deep, deep down into the earth extends
the flue, its wall hung with lava stalactites and patches
of lava that solidified as the material dripped back
into the interior after an explosion.</p>

<p>Of the scores of craters around <i>Mývatn</i> that I explored,
only one contained water,—except those in the
lake,—and this one is known as <i>Thangbrandspollr</i>,
<i>Thangbrand’s</i> Pool. <i>Thangbrand</i> was a Saxon Priest
whom Olaf Tryggvason, King of Norway (995-1000
A. D.) sent to Iceland to perform a wholesale christening
of the pagans. King <i>Olaf</i> forced Christianity upon
his subjects at the point of the sword, killing and plundering
all who refused to forsake the worship of <i>Thor</i>
and <i>Odin</i> and take the christening. <i>Thangbrand</i> was
chosen for the Icelandic mission because of his inhuman
and zealous methods. He had, what he deserved, little
success. We read that,—</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>“Hall let himself be christened and all his household.”</p>

<p>It was merely the act without any conversion from
Scandinavian polytheism. Again we read,—</p>

<p>“Winterlid, the Scald, made a scurvy rime about
him,” <i>Thangbrand</i>. And again we find,—</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>“<i>Thorvald</i>, the Guileful, and <i>Winterlid</i>, the Scald,
made a scurvy rime about <i>Thangbrand</i>, but he slew
them both. <i>Thangbrand</i> abode three winters in Iceland,
and was the bane of men or ever he departed
thence.”</p>

<p>It is reported in Iceland that this Pool is the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
where <i>Thangbrand</i> christened his converts. Since it
is authentic that he passed the time in Iceland at the
home of <i>Hall</i>, which was in the southeast of Iceland,
it is not likely that this is the real pool, although it is
true that christenings took place in this pool at very
early times. The Vikings did not take very kindly to
the christening and the following facts will be of interest
to those who dispute over the correct method of
baptism. When the priests found that the Icelanders
were the most stubborn of all the pagans of their experience
about the rite of christening, the priests
changed their tactics and performed their christenings
in the warm pools adjacent to the hot springs. Their
method of baptism in the eleventh century in Iceland
may be inferred.</p>

<p>The Saga references show that the <i>Mývatn</i> region
was an important place in the early days of colonization
and in subsequent centuries and we reluctantly close the
old annals so full of interest to the antiquarian and the
historian, and turn again to a more general view of the
<i>Mývatn</i> of the present. The view from <i>Skútustaðir</i> is
remarkable and of great variety. In the foreground,
the quiet lake, alive with water fowl and fringed with
prosperous farms, presents a picture of pastoral peace
and beauty; in the distance across the lake rise clouds
of steam and sulfurous gases from the sizzling solfataras
of <i>Námaskarð</i>, Sulfur-Pass; to the left rises
the innocent looking peaks of <i>Krafla</i>, Creeping, and
<i>Leirnúkr</i>, Mud-Peak, two famous volcanoes; to the
right, the prominent feature in the landscape is <i>Hverfjall</i>,
Hot-Spring-Mountain. <i>Hverfjall</i> is a large circular
crater of the explosion type. It stands 700 feet
above the level of the plain and is 4875 feet in diameter
across the top. It is four miles in circumference at the
summit of the rim. The interior is a mass of fragments
and crushed rubble. There is a large mound in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
center composed of crumpled lava with angular edges.
It is doubtful if lava ever flowed from this great crater,
although there was said to have been an eruption in
1728. I found no evidence of such eruption, other
than that of a violent upheaval of the crust due to internal
explosions of a mighty character. A force beyond
human comprehension or calculation thrust upwards
this enormous mass and dropped the titanic fragments
in the form of this circular wall 700 feet high
here,—</p>

<p>The farm at <i>Skútustaðir</i> is one to which my thoughts
often revert. I spent some time there in 1910 and
was so charmed with the place and delighted with the
Dean and his family that I returned to it for a more
extended visit in 1913. The Dean has since moved
to <i>Hólmar, Eskifjörðr</i>. <i>Skútustaðir</i> is a scene unmatched
in Iceland, the lake, the sloping uplands
clothed with excellent grass and sprinkled with a wealth
of Arctic flowers, the flocks and herds in the succulent
pastures, the farm buildings, <i>Thinghús</i> and church
grouped on an eminence between two bodies of water
and the grand panorama of meadows, rivers and volcanoes,
with their ascending columns and clouds of
steam,—a panorama that is well worth a summer and
ten thousand miles of travel. On each of my visits
the haying was in full swing. The men rose early to
cut the grass in the dew and paused at midday for a
long rest and a plunge in the lake while the raking, bundling
and stacking continued well into the night. Numerous
cocks of hay rose from the closely pared turf,
many wild ducks led their young from one sheet of
water to the other, crossing the yard between the buildings
or pausing around the haycocks to pick the numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
insects or venturing close to the doorways of the
buildings for bits of food. Along the margin of the
lake I found many of the swimming sandpipers, <i>Lobipes
hyperboreus</i>, the <i>Northern Phalarope</i>. It is a beautiful
bird and at <i>Mývatn</i> it is so tame that one may sit
quietly on the bank and coax it up within a few feet of
the shore where it will dart about picking up the insects
thrown to it. I devoted an hour to studying this
bird, feeding it in groups of several and in taking their
photographs. What a shame it is that New England
birds are not treated with the same thoughtfulness as
the birds of Iceland! These birds were within a minute’s
walk of the house.</p>

<p>We strolled around the east side of the lake to the
north shore and for three days made our headquarters
at <i>Reykjahlið</i>, Smoking-Pass, a remnant of a once prosperous
farm which has been destroyed by the lava pouring
from the vents of the foot hills that surround
<i>Leirhnúkr</i>. English travellers of casual observation
have stated that this great flood of lava came from
the volcano itself but if they had taken the trouble to
follow the streams of lava from the farm to their
source, they would have found that a deep valley runs
between these foothills and the real volcano of <i>Leirhnúkr</i>.
This lava flowed during the years 1725, 1727,
1728 and 1729. <i>Leirhnúkr</i> was active at the same
time, hence their error in attributing this sheet of lava
to the volcano. The volcano has enough havoc to its
discredit without charging it with the crime of ruining
the fertile plains at the north end of the lake. In 1729
an extensive tract of grazing and mowing land of rare
fertility was overflowed by molten rock. Some branches
of the stream entered the lake and quenched their ardent
fires, one branch flowed to the northeast corner of the
church and was arrested in its flow within two feet of
the building. Here the stream divided into two arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
and flowed around the edifice reuniting about sixty feet
from the opposite corner, leaving the church entirely
unharmed in the midst of the terrific heat of its fiery
glow. Says Henderson, who mused at length over the
incident,—</p>

<p>“Who knows but the effectual earnest prayer of some
pious individual, or some designs of mercy, may have
been the cause fixed in the eternal purpose of Jehovah
for the preservation of this edifice?”</p>

<p>On this same farm, and at some distance from the
margin of the lake, there is a deep rift in the plain, the
descent into which is made with little difficulty. There
is an abundance of water in the rift at a temperature
of 90°F. The place is called <i>Stórigjá</i>, Large-Rift,
and is a result of prehistoric earthquake action. The
rift is very deep and extends up near to the hot mountain
from whence issues the hot water. The water in
the bed of the chasm is clear as crystal and reflects most
beautifully the narrow streak of sky and the flower encrusted
walls. Here the wild geranium and ferns grow
abundantly, almost tropically, on the walls and in the
clefts of the rocks. It was a novel experience to take
a swim deep down in the crust of the earth in this hot
water of emerald hue, to look up the chasm and see the
towering ridges wreathed with rising steam and then
to turn about and gaze towards the snow-capped peaks
beyond the other end of the rift. The bath is invigorating
and puts vigor and elasticity into the body to such
a degree that it is noticeable for hours afterwards. It
has been thought to be strongly radio-active.</p>

<p>No journey to <i>Reykjahlið</i> would be complete without
a visit to the small island of <i>Slútness</i>, one of the extinct
craters in the lake. It is a paradise for ducks. Having
obtained permission of the farmer at <i>Grimstaðir</i>,
Grim’s-Farm, who owns the island, we rowed out to
the island accompanied by the farmer and <i>Ólafur</i>. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
a place for ducks we had never seen; they breed in
thousands on the small islands in the lake and in the
retired creeks, but the island of <i>Slútness</i> is one great
nest for ducks. The farmer told us that he had already
taken over 13,000 eggs from the island that season,
and had left sufficient for breeding purposes. These
eggs are packed in water-glass for winter consumption.
One may walk across the island in three minutes with
ease and this makes the number of birds seem all the
larger. During the nesting season it is not possible to
step anywhere without taking precaution not to tread
upon the birds. Here one may see the Golden Eyed
Duck, <i>Clangula Islandica</i>, in all its glory, lift it from
the nest for photographing and return it without any
apparent disturbance to the bird. The eider duck,
<i>Somateria Mollissima Dresseri</i>, is abundant on this island,
though usually seeking the sea coast during the
nesting season. The island itself, even if the birds were
missing, is charming. It is circular in form, with the
crater portion filled with water to the level of the lake.
It is in this water that the ducklings take their first
swimming exercises. In many places it was literally
covered with the puffy brown balls that darted hither
and yon amid the loud scolding of the numerous mothers
in their efforts to keep the different families from
getting inextricably mixed. Around the margin of the
basin there is a remarkable plant society with numerous
members, wonderful for this high latitude, above Lat.
65°-30´. The mountain ash and Arctic willow form
dense thickets near the margin of the pool and close to
the water the Angelica, <i>Angelica officinalis</i>, stands to
a height of five feet and when crushed fills the air with
the fragrance of its oil. This plant grows luxuriantly
on many portions of the lake shore as well as on the
islands and it is highly prized by the inhabitants. The
list of plants which we collected here is too long to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
in full. There were over thirty specimens of flowering
plants, among which we noticed the violets in dense
mats, vigorous geraniums, <i>Geranium maculatum</i>, with
larger and deeper colored blossoms than in New England,
dandelions and arnica in great profusion, asters,
marigolds and wild pinks. This island will yield a good
deal of information to the botanist interested in <i>Ecology</i>
and in the variation of species.</p>

<p>The house at <i>Reykjahlið</i>, is an ancient one built of
turf and stone with the usual turf roof, covered with
grass in a flourishing condition. In front of the house
is the only windmill that I have seen in Iceland. The
sails are of galvanized iron and laid on the yards in
squares like the glass in a window. The mill is a small
affair and is used to grind barley and rye for the use of
the family. No grain is raised in the country but it
is all imported from Europe and ground as needed.
The entrance to the house, like the one described in the
chapter on <i>Hekla</i>, is through a hallway with an age-trodden
floor. The guest room is finished in wood
and we found it neat and clean. We are glad to report
this state of cleanliness because the English writers tell
strange tales about the uncleanliness of this house and
its vermin-infested guest room. The people at the farm
spoke no English but they waited upon us with the customary
Icelandic cordiality and we thoroughly enjoyed
the several meals prepared especially for our table. The
trout came fresh from the lake and the prime eggs from
ducks’ nests on the islands.</p>

<p>One day I found a magnificent specimen of an edible
mushroom, <i>Lycoperdon giganteum</i>, and to the horror
of the people on the farm I requested that it be cooked.
This specimen was ten inches in diameter, hard, white
and in prime condition. It had been long since we had
tasted mushrooms and our vegetable diet had been a
sparing one since we left the steamer, so I persisted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
through Ólafur, that “the Americans really mean that
they wish this mushroom cooked and they will eat it.”
Our directions were carefully followed and the <i>Lycoperdon</i>
came to the table well prepared and in full flavor.
What consternation it created in the kitchen we will
never know, save that there was much talking there
and uproarious laughter in that department during the
cooking process. The maiden who brought it to the
table came in with a blushing face and ill-concealed
laughter at some remarks that followed as she left the
kitchen. It certainly was delicious and after we had
dipped deeply into the contents of the tureen, Ólafur
was persuaded to try it and the farmer standing in the
doorway looked aghast when he saw Ólafur eat it.
Ólafur pronounced it good and invited the farmer to
try it but the latter shook his head in a manner to
convince us that he had no idea of being so unwise
as to eat such a thing. On the following morning when
I called for the remainder, the response was,—“it is
all gone.” Whether they threw it away or whether
it was eaten after consultation with Ólafur I will never
know for a certainty but I believe that it was eaten, also
I believe that every sizable <i>Lycoperdon</i> growing on this
farm in the future is destined for the stew pan with real
cream.</p>

<p>We tarried at the farm for three days and during
this time we had every possible attention paid to our
comfort. The farmer always came to our room during
meals and took coffee with us and smoked a cigar at
the end. He always proffered his snuff horn to me
but I was impolite enough to refuse this courtesy. Snuff
taking is universal among the men. When two men
meet upon the trail, whether they know each other or
not, they salute, each brings out the snuff horn and the
horns are exchanged. A little is then poured upon the
back of the left wrist from which it is snuffed up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
right and then the left nostril. One or two violent
sneezes follow, each man trying to sneeze the louder in
compliment to the finer quality of the other’s snuff,
though it often happens that both horns were filled
out of the same jar in the store. The sneezing over,
they again shake hands, salute and ride their several
ways.</p>

<p class="dropcap">In the early morning we mounted the best of our
ponies for the toilsome ascent of <i>Krafla</i>, Creeping.
We crossed the intervening ridge of mountains
through the pass of <i>Námaskarð</i>, Solfatara-Pass,
which is a deep defile in the volcanic range. At the
base of this ridge there are spread out broad plains
of multi-colored earth from which clouds of steam and
sulfur gases ascend, which are visible for many miles
across the lake. With caution we picked a way for the
ponies amid the fumaroles and entered the pass. As
far as the eye can range, this slope of the mountain is
strewn with crystals of sulfur and gypsum interspersed
with alum and needle zeolites in various forms. This
slope is thinly crusted and perforated, like a skimmer,
with orifices whence issue vile smelling gases to mingle
with the steam and become dissipated in the upper air.</p>

<p>From the summit of the pass an extensive view of
the <i>Mývatns Öraefa</i>, Desolate Lava of <i>Mývatn</i>, is obtained
towards the northeast. It is a trackless ruin
wrought by the combined labors of several volcanoes
and contains no vegetation save patches of lichens that
nourish a small herd of reindeer. At the foot of the
slope upon which we halted a vast plain spreads out
into the <i>Öraefa</i>. This plain is covered with a thin
crust of chemical earths which rest upon a substratum
of viscid, hot and sulfur-permeated clay. At the margin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
we left the ponies and ventured cautiously upon
the crust, recalling the experience of Dr. Hooker in a
similar situation at <i>Krisuvik</i>, where he nearly lost his
life by sinking into the hot mass. The crust will support
the curious traveller if he is sufficiently cautious
in choosing his route by sounding the shell in front
of him with a staff. It reminded me of an experience I
had when a boy in watching my father cross a river
upon thin ice, where he sounded the ice step by step
in advance with the pole of his axe while I followed
with great temerity over the cracking ice. As I expressed
my fear of breaking through, he replied, “it
will hold as long as it cracks.” And so with the sulfur
crust above the seething furies, “it will hold as
long as it cracks.” Woe to him who fails to sound
this undulating crust before his advancing steps! All
of this crust is composed of sublimated chemicals
brought to the surface by the superheated gases. The
crystals are various in form according to their chemical
constituents and together they present a discordant color
scheme, much like a painter’s palette where the various
color daubs have run together. As one crunches the
crystals beneath his feet he has the sensation of walking
with hob-nails through a jeweller’s showcase.</p>

<p>This Arctic Phlegethon is mottled with pits of boiling
bolus. There are four principal groups of these
mud cauldrons, each in a basin of baked mud, elevated
a few feet above the level of the plain. In 1910 one
of these groups contained seven cauldrons, the largest
being thirty feet in diameter. The cauldrons are not
permanent but crust over from time to time and new
ones form in the adjacent areas. The mud rises slowly
in a gigantic bubble, like the sticky bubbles on the surface
of hot molasses candy, until the gas pressure is
sufficient to burst the film, when a cloud of gases suddenly
shoots upward, a hot shower of mud is ejected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and then the entire mass slides back into the bowels of
the earth with a horrid, sickening gasp. It is now
safe to mount the rim and watch the mass as it slowly
wells upwards for another display. Standing in a bath
of vapors one looks backward over the track whence
he came and notes tiny columns of steam marking the
trail along which he so recently advanced. Every place
in the crust that was punctured with the staff is slowly
changing into a cauldron like the one at his feet and
the traveller experiences a sensation of uneasiness,
knowing, as he does, that in a brief time a new line
of cauldrons will be in operation and for the first time
he fully realizes the insecurity of his position and he
longs for the solidity of the lava ridge where he left
the hobbled ponies.</p>

<p>Because it suggests the food that may be provided
for the guests of the Inferno, the Icelander has named
the material within the smoking cauldrons “hell-broth”
and the name can not be improved. They boil and
splutter, spatter and emit abundant volumes of steam
and make a great fuss over the little matter of a solid
nature that is ejected. These spiteful explosions are
worthy of greater results.</p>

<div class="verse">“And still the smouldering flame lurks underground</div>
<div class="verse">And tosses boiling fountains to the sky.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For two hours we wandered among the fumaroles
and fountains of seething mud. Oftentimes the crust
cracked viciously beneath our feet and we retreated
precipitously to a thicker portion of the shell which
covers this vast subterranean fire. It gave us much
amusement to plug up the orifices of the small fumaroles
with plastic clay and sulfur and to wait for them to
burst forth spitefully and hurl out a shower of scorching mud.</p>

<p>Following a narrow sheep trail between the edge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the lava and the high ridge that connects <i>Námarskartð</i>
with <i>Leirnúkr</i> and <i>Krafla</i>, we arrived at a lonely spot,
a deserted Icelandic farm with tumbled down buildings,
which gave evidence of having been a prosperous
stead before the lava flood spread its fiery wings over
the valley. Here we paused for lunch. Among our
steamer gifts was a package which was marked for us to
open some day when we desired a change from our
regular fare. We put it into our hamper that morning
and rejoiced to find a bottle of delicious olives.
We washed down this lunch with acid water from the
brook, which we later found to have its origin in one
of the craters of <i>Krafla</i>. On our return from the summit,
the ponies, who had had no water for several hours,
went eagerly to this brook but after one taste they
trotted along. Curious to know why they would not
drink since they had freely done so in the morning, I
dismounted and tasted the water. It had become much
more acid and I could account for it only by supposing
that a larger volume than usual had issued from the
crater and that there had been less snow water for its
dilution than when we had lunched.</p>

<p>The climb soon began in earnest. In a long series
of zigzag curves we crossed ridge after ridge of sticky
clay interspersed with volcanic ash and pumice. Having
gained the summit of the ash ridges we photographed
the distant peak of <i>Krafla</i>, traversed a bit of
high moorland containing a small crater lake of blue
water, entered a sheltered valley between the upper peak
of <i>Krafla</i> and <i>Hrafntinnuhryggr</i>, Raven-Peaks-Back,
a ridge of obsidian or Icelandic agate. Enormous
masses of jet black obsidian of the purest form rise
from this ridge and millions of these glass boulders
are piled in a talus at the base of the cliffs. I secured
an excellent specimen seven inches in diameter, pointed
at one side and with a beautiful and double conchoidal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
fracture for the science museum at Springfield, Mass.</p>

<p>We left the tired ponies to graze in the bit of grass
while we made the final ascent of the mountain, which
is far above the craters. The slope is steep and is
clothed with a thick mat of birches to the very edge
of the snow in the ravine. These birches are so small
that an entire tree, roots, stem, leaves and catkin may
be placed upon a five cent piece without projecting.
We saw many tracks of reindeer and picked up a fine
set of antlers of the last casting. The herd of these
animals in the vicinity of <i>Krafla</i> is thriving as they are
undisturbed by the natives.</p>

<p>On the very tip-top of the mountain we erected a
cairn and deposited a record of our ascent in a metal
cylinder. We then photographed the official flag of
the Arctic Club of America and examined the broad
and horrent country surrounding the base of this volcano.
Before I went to Iceland my mountain climbing
had been confined to the mountains of New Hampshire,
where a magnificent, virgin forest clothes the
middle and lower slopes. To stand upon any mountain
in Iceland, with White Mountain impressions in
the mind, and gaze at the barrenness of the surrounding
country affords the greatest possible contrast.</p>

<p>The view from the summit of <i>Krafla</i> is imposing
but not so extensive as from <i>Hekla</i>. Unlike <i>Hekla</i>
the craters are on the slope and far below the summit.
The top of <i>Krafla</i> is a jumbled mass of disintegrating
<i>granophyre</i>. The view down the eastern slope and
across the intervening space to <i>Leirnúkr</i> is plutonic and
exceedingly wild. In the distance a mass of lava hangs
upon the side of <i>Leirnúkr</i> like a petrified waterfall,
nearer and on the middle slopes of <i>Krafla</i> are several
old craters filled with water from which columns of
steam continually ascend. One of them is a double
crater with confluent edges. It is filled with water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
which boils violently along the side next to the summit
of the mountain. The craters are at an elevation of
1700 feet above sea level and in the days when Henderson
visited them they were in a violent state of
action. On July 15, 1910, we found them provokingly
quiet. At some distance down the mountain below the
crater lakes there is a great rift cutting deeply into the
side of the mountain. Here we found considerable activity.
The cleft was so filled with clouds of steam
that my photograph of it reveals little except the belching
vapors. If I had had a phonograph I could have
brought home a record of growling, roaring, impatient
muttering that burst into explosive thunders that would
have been of scientific interest at least if not to the
popular ear. The odors of sulfur gases were sufficiently
strong to stifle any one except a chemist accustomed to
the fragrance of the laboratory. If I had had an instrument
to record odors I could have brought away
a collection of these simple and multiple combinations
of smells that would have startled the dullest of olefactory
nerves. The name of this rift in Icelandic is
<i>Víti</i>, signifying <i>Hell</i>, well named.</p>

<p><i>Krafla</i> is not dead, merely sleeping. In the past
centuries it has wrought great havoc. The eruption of
May 17, 1724, was so violent that the ashes and pumice
on the eastern shore of <i>Mývatn</i> were deposited to a
depth of over three feet. The connection between
<i>Krafla</i> and <i>Leirnúkr</i> is close, in reality they are one
volcano with different craters. <i>Leirnúkr</i> had a violent
eruption in 1725, to which reference was made in the
preceding chapter, and during the following four years
there were three more eruptions that did great damage.</p>

<p>The extended view from <i>Krafla</i> is desolate and dreary
in the extreme. When the eye ranges beyond the smoking
slopes of mighty <i>Krafla</i> it meets the greatest lava
desolation in the north of Iceland. In the distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
flashes of the <i>Jökulsá</i>, Ice-Mountain-River, are seen as
it labors through the twisted lava to plunge into the
abyss of the <i>Dettifoss</i>. The southern view commands
the low volcanoes surrounding <i>Mývatn</i>. To the left
rises the obsidian mountain and at our very feet ascend
the roaring columns out of <i>Víti</i> to their dissipation in
the upper air.</p>

<p>Descending to our ponies we decided to traverse the
unexplored portion of the mountain by a spiral route.
We soon became entangled in an intricate mesh of deep,
soft gullies. The great depth of these gullies, the
ridges of dry ashes that surmounted them, the steep,
viscid slopes and the beds filled with running water hot
and odorous, wherein a peculiar alga thrives, and the
intervening reaches of slumpy snow afforded us two
hours of very laborious work. Cautiously we proceeded,
leading the ponies, searching for places to descend
the slopes and then working much harder to get out
of the ravine, only to find it necessary to repeat the performance
many times. The trusting beasts followed
our ignominious slides into the gulches and after much
coaxing managed to scramble up after us into the dry
ashes at the top. We photographed these gullies, descended
to the sheep trail and after three and one half
hours of hard riding returned to our comfortable quarters
at <i>Reykjalíð</i> farm, where we did ample justice to
the supper which the farmer’s daughter had prepared
for us. On the menu was an excellent item that was
new to us, a sweet purple soup.</p>

<p>The minerals and lava specimens that I had collected
up to this time were packed and left with the
farmer who engaged for a <i>kroner</i> to transport them to
<i>Húsavik</i> when he went to this trading station in the
autumn. In due course of time the box, which I had
left to his care, arrived safely in Springfield,—another
instance of the faithfulness of the Icelander in keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
his word. The reader will note the difference in the
cost of packing a box of seventy-five pounds on the back
of a pony for two days and the tariff of the Express
Companies of America.</p>

<p>On the morrow we rode through the lava beds that
fringe the eastern shore of <i>Mývatn</i> just after a clearing
shower and the sunlight upon the crater islands, the
lichen-encrusted lava ridges and the play of light
upon the water of the land-locked pools was of
surprising beauty. As we neared <i>Kálfstrond</i>, Calf-Strand,
an Icelandic shepherd dog ran out to meet
us and gave a noisy welcome. For the size of
the dog the Iceland variety has the strongest lungs
of any member of the canine family. They will
run for half a mile to meet the traveller yelping
and crying and will often follow him for miles
after leaving the farm. One of these fluffy balls of
animation stayed with us for several days and resisted
all our efforts to leave him behind. We left him in
a stable with instructions to keep him till some one
returned to the farm from whence he had run away
but at noon as we were fording a river he joyously
arrived. The cold stream was no obstacle, he was the
first on the opposite shore and stayed with us until we
arrived at <i>Reykjavik</i>. He lost no opportunity to get
into our room at the hotel, invariably found us if we
went for a walk and when we pushed from the landing
in a small boat to go out into the stream to board
our steamer for home, he jumped from the wharf into
the boat and stuck to us till we ascended the gang
plank and as the boat pulled ashore he gave one long
and mournful cry. My heart has often turned towards
the faithfulness and the attachment of this little
fellow and often do I wonder if he is following the
sheep over his native hills forgetful of the summer’s escapade
when he ran away to associate with strangers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Beneath the lava ridges great streams of water from
the neighboring mountains pour into the lake and
around these inlets there is always excellent trout fishing.
The trout are large and abundant. Between the
lake and <i>Hverfjall</i> the lava is rifted into deep ravines
and mighty cliffs which, in their castellated and architectural
forms, coated with lichens, present more the
appearance of being the handiwork of man than that
of subterranean powers assisted by the frosts of time.
Little imagination is necessary to view in this mass
of plutonic rock the Gothic arches of a long deserted
cloister, and in that pile of ragged crust, the ramparts
and bastions of a mediaeval fortress. Lofty piles stand
side by side upon the plain suggestive of triumphal
arches whose capstone has fallen to the ground.</p>

<p>On arriving at <i>Skútustaðir</i> we found that Baron Klinckowström,
his son Harald and Walter Friedeberg,
whom we had met on the <i>Botnia</i>, had arrived and
established themselves in the <i>Thinghús</i>. Here they
were busy in preparing bird skins for museums in Stockholm,
Berlin, and the private collection of Harald. It
was a pleasure to see a youth like Harald cling for
hours to the trying labor of preparing bird skins.
Later I examined his large and excellent collection of
mounted birds at his father’s castle at Stafsund near
Stockholm and I could not help admiring the energy
and perseverance of the youth as well as the skill manifest
in mounting this collection, all of which was the
work of his unaided hands. The boy with a purpose,
who lives largely in the open, even though he may be
deprived of the university, is sure to obtain a most
liberal education, an education that comes through the
eye and is augmented by thought. Later, when I had
had a chance to study the daily life of a boy in the
public schools of Sweden and draw a comparison with
that of an American youth, I understood how that little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
country of mountains and lakes had produced so
many remarkable men, such as Berzelius, Linnaeus,
Bergman, Scheele and Arrhenius. It is the spirit that
dominates the boy in successful education, not the
special advantages of his equipment.</p>

<p>We had planned to leave <i>Skútustaðir</i> at eight in the
morning but it was one in the afternoon when we parted
from our genial host. His little daughter opened the
<i>tún</i> gate and we rode out upon the great heath which
reaches from <i>Mývatn</i> to <i>Ljósavatn</i>. The great delay
was caused by the straying of the ponies. A week before
I had swapped a pony with the farmer at Ljósavatn.
The pony had taken it into his wise little head
to return to his old home without the trouble of carrying
his pack and he was followed by three of our riding
ponies. It was several hours before <i>Ólafur</i> overtook
them and returned to the lake. The innumerable
midges around the lake greatly annoy the ponies and
often cause them to wander. Sometimes they are so
violently attacked by swarms of these insects that they
will rush headlong into the water to rid themselves of
their tormentors. When the grass is good and the wind
and midges do not annoy, they do not wander but graze
quietly during the night and are easily captured when
wanted. A child with a string will go to the grazing
land, fasten it around the lower jaw of one of the
ponies, mount and drive the troup to the farm house to
be saddled. It is never necessary, as it often is in New
England, to spend an hour to coax a horse with a measure
of grain. The Icelandic horse is a type peculiar to
the country. He is the descendant of the Scandinavian
steed taken to that country centuries since by the early
settlers. He has become thoroughly inured to the conditions
and has developed characteristics not found in
any other breed of horses. His weight is from 500 to
600 pounds, though some run a little heavier. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
mane is very thick and long; the tail is a great brush
about ten inches in diameter and unless clipped drags
upon the ground. In the driving wind, rain or sleet,
the pony turns his tail to the storm and with lowered
head, if untethered, walks out the gale. The wind
spreads the thick hair over his hips and even though
matted upon the surface with sleet it becomes an admirable
protection. The hair of the tail is very long
and is used by the farmers for making ropes to bind
hay. The horses are well built, usually fat, free from
blemishes, slender in the legs, wide between the eyes,
broad backed and deep chested. Their sagacity is remarkable.
In fording rivers, in crossing the ragged
lava, in picking their way over stone-strewn heaths,
across quaking bogs, or in the rugged defiles or on the
precipitous slopes of the trailless mountains, they are
the wisest, kindest, surest and the finest saddle horses.</p>

<p>The endurance of these little steeds is a continual surprise
to the stranger. In the bogs and in rubble riding
they are extremely cautious and if they are allowed
to negotiate the difficult places in their own way, will
never bring the rider to grief. I said they were sure
footed and the fact that I have been thrown a few times
is not contrary to the statement. When a pony is ridden
at an eight mile pace down a declivity thickly
strewn with loose stones, if he stumbles three times a
month it should not be attributed to the pony as a
fault but rather to the recklessness of his rider. Their
living is obtained entirely out of doors. In the spring
the young horses are driven into the mountains where
they run wild until late in the autumn when they are
taken to the farm for the winter. It is only occasionally
during the most severe portion of the winter that they
are provided with hay and never with grain, except
work-horses in the city. When four years old they are
broken to the saddle. There are about 50,000 ponies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
in the country and hundreds are exported to Denmark
and Scotland yearly. The steamer upon which we returned
from Iceland the first summer carried 376
ponies. The saddle ponies have different steps, some
amble, some trot, some gallop, some pace,—all have at
least two of these methods while some of them have
all of these methods and a good rider can take his
choice or have his pony change from one to another.</p>

<p>A troup of ponies on a journey will usually stay together.
Although we frequently passed through mountain
pastures where scores of horses were grazing, we
never knew one of our ponies to leave the company of
his own companions. On arrival at a farm the ponies
are led with a string, for the Icelander is jealous of
every blade of grass within his enclosure and it is a
mark of discourtesy to permit the ponies to graze about
the buildings. The best ponies are raised in the rich
valleys of the north rivers and it is there that the Icelandic
gentleman goes for his fancy saddle horse, as
the Yankee formerly went to Kentucky.</p>

<p>The straying of the ponies is not the only cause of
a late departure in the morning. The Icelander is
never in a hurry. Every night we held a solemn council
with the guide and it was usually agreed that we would
leave at nine in the morning, sometimes the time set
was eight. But, if the ponies had not strayed then it
was found that several of them must be shod; if they
did not need shoeing the saddles needed attention; if
the saddles were in good condition then the morning
coffee was late, so that we usually started two hours
after the appointed time.</p>

<p>The best advice to a prospective Yankee in Iceland
is,—Do not fret. Go and take photographs while the
ponies are being saddled. When they are saddled go
and take some more. When everything is ready, start.
To the nervous and rushing American this is an unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
procedure. But, the charm of Icelandic travel
is the abundance of time, freedom from any real cause
for worry and the knowledge that darkness can not
overtake the summer traveller, no matter where or
when he travels. There is also the certainty that he
will receive a cordial reception, no matter when he arrives.
Impatient Americans need a summer on horseback
in Iceland to curb their impetuosity.</p>

<p>One day we had a pleasant experience in calling at a
farm house where lived friends of our guide. We were
invited into the guest room which contained a narrow
bed, a big round table and an organ made in Brattleboro,
Vt. Our host produced the usual horn of snuff
and with it some excellent cigars. He then played
and sang to us in Icelandic,—“There’s a Land that is
Fairer than Day.” He wished us to photograph his
children but their mother first insisted in putting them
through the hair-combing process. After this they were
lined up in front of the house, seven in a row. After
repeated efforts on the part of the older ones to keep
the hands of their baby brother out of his mouth the
picture was taken with success. The mother disappeared
for half an hour and then returned with coffee
and freshly made pancakes rolled in sugar.</p>

<p>The host and hostess then showed us all over their
house, a turf structure and typical of the older houses
in the country. Such farm houses contain narrow, windowless
corridors, winding in labyrinthian maze from
room to room. In this house one passageway led to a
large open mound where a fire is made to smoke fish and
meat and incidentally the whole house and everything in
it. Another passage leads to the real kitchen with an iron
stove. The walls are all of turf as are the partitions
and the roof, with just enough driftwood in the roof
to make a framework to hold the turf in place. Steep
stairs lead to the <i>baðstofa</i>, sleeping apartment, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
frequently forms the sleeping and sitting room and the
common work room of the entire family, especially in
winter. Bunks built into the wall extend around the
room and are frequently filled with seaweed or feathers
over which is spread a fold or two of wadmal and a
thick coverlet of eider down. The floor of the <i>baðstofa</i>
is of boards but the floors down stairs are frequently
of hard earth which frequently becomes damp.
From the ceiling are suspended numerous articles of
domestic economy while large chests, ornately carved,
containing clothing and valuables are scattered through
the house.</p>

<p>On another occasion at midnight after Mrs. Russell
and I had retired, the hostess came into the guest room
and asked us if we would like to go up into the <i>baðstofa</i>
and see the family in bed. We promptly accepted
the invitation and ascending the ladder found
the family abed, head to foot, separated by the boards
previously described, family and farm hands, men and
women, children, young men and maidens, each asleep
and unconscious of our intrusion. This has been the
custom of centuries. There are no partitions, no draperies,
and there is no false modesty, no resulting immorality.
The marriage vow is seldom anticipated
and I firmly believe the degree of morality is higher
in this land than in any other.</p>

<p class="dropcap">During the summer day Akureyri is a busy
place. It is the emporium of the north, the
resort of the fishermen from the northern
waters and the place where the farmers of
the north of Iceland exchange their produce for European
supplies. The city is comfortably situated at the
head of the longest fiord in Iceland. There is one street
that runs between the water and the high hill towards
the west. The population is about 1,500. There are
several shops and good stores, a public library. Two
newspapers are published in the city. There is a high
school and an agricultural college. One baker in the
city is also a photographer and there one may purchase
a photograph or a cruller over the same counter.</p>

<p>At the upper end of the street there is a commodious
and well constructed church. Several of the front
yards boast fine clumps of mountain ash; one of these
tree clumps is the pride of the city, as it has attained
a considerable growth, a remarkable size for this exposure
and high latitude. Behind the street on the
steep hillside, patches of potatoes and turnips checker
the entire bank of the fiord for a mile or more. It is a
pleasing picture when contrasted with the grimness of
the ice-covered ridges beyond.</p>

<p>There is a spacious hotel, long kept by an eccentric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Dane by the name of Jensen. It has recently changed
hands. I have often heard it stated that he had no regular
scale of prices but charged his guests according to
his likes or dislikes. If the guest was winning, the
genial Dane reduced the charge; but if the guest had
been disagreeable, or in any way did not appeal to
the fancy of the proprietor, then the price was raised.
Whatever the truth of the report may be, one thing is
certain, the host was genial, kept a good house, cared
for his guests, and the prices, according to my experience,
were reasonable. It is possible that his philosophy
was correct, that the guest who makes unnecessary demands
or is difficult to please should be the one to pay
the extras, while the guest who takes what is provided,
makes no special demands, considers the local conditions
which obtain and demands no special service for himself
at the expense of other guests, should be favored in
the reckoning. I think Jensen’s method is correct. How
he regarded us I do not know; suffice it to state that we
had a good room with two beds and excellent food in
a private dining room with the best of attention and
that our bill for twenty-four hours was only the equivalent
of two dollars for both of us.</p>

<p>There was one exception to our comfort at this hostelry,
but this can not be charged to the eccentricity of
the landlord. My bed seemed comfortable when I retired,
but long before I went to sleep I found a hard
bunch in the mattress that persisted in getting between
my shoulders no matter how I twisted and turned. It
was a narrow bed and afforded me no retreat from the
offending bunch. I rose, stripped the bed, instituted
a search and finally ripped open the mattress at the corner,
worked that lump to the slit and pulled out a
rooster’s head with the longest bill that was ever presented
to me in Iceland. It had been pecking my
shoulders persistently in spite of the fact that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
rooster had fought his last fight many years since. If
I had damaged the cover a little, I reasoned that I had
avenged the sleeplessness of many a former occupant
of this couch and was rendering a good service to
future guests.</p>

<p>Akureyri is the home of the venerable poet, <i>Matthias
Jöckumsson</i>, born in 1833, a lyric poet of the
highest rank, who has also written excellent drama.
It was our pleasure one day while fording the <i>Heraðsvötn</i>,
District-Waters, to meet him. Riding off the little
ferry he came to us with hat in hand and his white
locks flowing in the wind. Holding out his right hand
to us he said,—</p>

<p>“Welcome, strangers, to Iceland!”</p>

<p>At the far end of the city, in fact a continuation of
the one street, is <i>Oddeyri</i>, Point of Land, under a
different political jurisdiction from <i>Akureyri</i>. It is a
busy place in the whaling and herring season and contains
a large store operated by the Danish-Icelandic
Trading Company. It has two banks and has recently
become the center of the shipping interests by reason
of its new wharf which enables steamers to discharge
cargo without the use of lighters. The curing and
rendering establishments in this town will repay a visit,
unless one has strong olefactory objections. When the
wind blows up the fiord there is no doubt as to the use
to which the buildings on the extreme point of land
north of the pier are put.</p>

<p>Leaving <i>Akureyri</i> we followed the west bank of the
grand <i>Eyjarfjörðr</i> till we arrived at the <i>Hörgá</i>, Howe-River,
whence we looked across the level meadows to
the former location of the Agricultural College at
<i>Möðruvellir</i>, Madder-Valley. The college is now located
at <i>Akureyri</i>. It is sometimes a surprise to learn
that there is such a college close to the Arctic Circle,
but it has a good reason for its existence. There is need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
for training the farmers in methods of cattle, horse and
sheep breeding, especially the latter, that they may win
the best possible success in their struggle with adverse
conditions. Jón Hjaltalin at one time was the head
master of this school and he also did service in Edinburgh,
Scotland, as a librarian.</p>

<p>The view across the valley is extensive and charming
because the rugged and ragged features of the
usual Icelandic landscape are softened by the river
winding through the undulating meadows which roll
upwards to the distance-softened ridges, while yet beyond,
the crumbling cinder cones melt into the whiteness
of the lofty <i>Vindheima Jökull</i>, Wind-Home-Glacier,
and flashing in the sun,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“A thousand rills</div>
<div class="verse">Come leaping from the mountain, each a fay,</div>
<div class="verse indent6">Sweet singing then;</div>
<div class="verse">‘O come with us out seaward, come away!’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We stopped for lunch beside a singing brook flowing
down from the ridge on our left and springing into
the <i>Hörgá</i>. The grass was in excellent condition and
the ponies grazed as if they had knowledge of the
poor quality of this necessity and its scarcity during
the following days. The cotton grass spread its sheets
of pearly white around us, forget-me-nots and marguerites,
the wild arnica and the violets reveled in the glory
of their bloom. We ate our lunch and reclined upon
the grass in full enjoyment of the scene and recalled
the former importance of this valley. It is as beautiful
to-day as when the Vikings first entered it. Since
their time no blasting volcano with fiery breath has
scorched its foliage nor poured its glinting lava in
destructive streams over the meadows and humble
homes. The days of feudal strife passed with the
Christian education of that sturdy race and the peace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the Cross now rests upon the valley like the “shadow
of a great rock in a weary land.”</p>

<p>The time of its literary importance passed with the
decline of its Abbey and the passing of Sira Jón Thorlakson,
the Icelandic Milton. Across the river, and
shaded by a noble clump of the mountain ash, stands
the home of this venerable poet and priest, <i>Baegisá</i>. A
century ago he translated Paradise Lost, Pope’s Essay
on Man, portions of Shakespeare, masterpieces of German
and Scandinavian literature into the Icelandic. Besides
being a translator, he composed a large amount of
Icelandic poetry in the <i>Eddic</i> phraseology which competent
judges say equalled and often surpassed the
masterpieces of the ancient scalds. He was sorely fettered
by poverty. When commenting upon the high
morality of his race and the great freedom from the
use of intoxicants by his people at that time he said,—</p>

<p>“Our poverty is the bulwark of our happiness.”</p>

<p>Again, speaking of poverty, the common lot of most
poets of all lands, and in all ages, he says, literally from
one of his poems,—</p>

<p>“Ever since I came into this world, I have been wedded
to poverty, who has hugged me to her bosom
these seventy winters all but two; whether we shall
ever be divorced here below, is only known to Him
who joined us together.”</p>

<p>From our vantage point we looked down upon three
beautiful valleys with as many rivers joining to form
the valley of the <i>Hörgá</i> and its mighty stream. These
are the <i>Hörgárdalr</i>, <i>Öxnadalr</i> and <i>Baegisádalr</i>. The
mountains rise to an elevation 4000 feet above the valley,
capped with snow or perpetual ice, their slopes
slashed into wild ravines and terraced with lava cliffs
down which course numerous cascades from the melting
snows. It is a fair and peaceful scene, this at
our feet: it is a grand and awesome sight, that greets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the lifted eye.</p>

<p>Fastening forget-me-nots into the manes of the ponies
we resumed our ride up the valley and turned into the
<i>Öxnadalr</i>, Ox-Valley. It is a fine illustration of a
glacial valley. The cross section is nearly a semicircle
and the sides are deeply grooved; the glacial
carving is much more pronounced than that of the
lower end of <i>Seyðisfjörðr</i>. We stopped over night at
<i>Thverá</i>, Tributary-River, in a humble home perched
upon the steep hillside above the river and just below
the ice cliffs.</p>

<p>Across the river rise the <i>Hraundrangar</i>, Lava Pillars,
which tower in a long chain of spires above the castellated
ridge, a prominent feature in the landscape for miles
up and down the valley. High up between the ridges
there is a sheet of water which pours out through a
small rift in the nearer ridge and falls into the valley
as if some Moses had smitten the lava wall with his
rod of wrath.</p>

<p>We enjoyed our stay at <i>Thverá</i> and experienced several
things of interest. It is an ancient farm located
on the trail through the defile where Icelanders have
passed between the east and west for a thousand years.
A newly wedded couple had just taken up their abode
under the paternal roof in this historic spot and were
beginning the problems of life where generations of
their ancestors had solved the same enigmas with the
variations which the succeeding centuries have added.
They were attentive to our necessities with the inborn
hospitality of the race but there was something in the
atmosphere that revealed the newness of the work and
the shyness of the wedded couple added much to our
amusement.</p>

</div>

<p>During the week the rapidly melting snows had carried
away the bridge over the <i>Thverá</i> and we found
it necessary to cross the torrent on a stringer. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
a little coaxing all the ponies walked across except our
faithful black pack pony. Vexed at the delay in removing
his packing boxes, and anxious to be with his
companions grazing on the opposite bank, he ran rapidly
up and down the stream, repeatedly trying the river
for a place to ford with his load which was still fastened
to the saddle. Ólafur was on the opposite side resaddling
the other ponies. Old Black became frantic,
shook himself repeatedly, ran sideways into a projecting
rock in the canyon and freed himself from his load;
he then ran to the stringer, crossed and grazed contentedly
with his mates and in positive forgetfulness of the
wreckage he had left strewn upon the opposite shore.
The cases had burst open and their contents were scattered
along the sides of the river and some of the
items were actually rescued with difficulty from the running
water. Fortunately Old Black was not carrying
my photograph outfit that morning as was his usual
custom. Again in 1913 in my crossing of the interior
of Iceland I had this same horse and of all the pack
ponies which I have used during my four different
journeys I have never found one equal in value to this
one. His peculiar trait was to pick a trail for himself
and his intelligence in this work was noteworthy. He
was always given the most valuable portion of my load
and whether in the bogs, on the rough mountains
where there were no trails or in the fording of difficult
rivers he was always worthy of the trust I imposed in
him. The one accident mentioned above is the only one
he has had in his long years of service as a pack
pony.</p>

<p>Clumps of mountain ash, in Europe called <i>rowan</i> tree,
here and there adorn a sheltered spot and their association
with the angular lava recalled to my mind the
<i>Lay of Geirod</i>, a kind of parable concerning the fires
of Iceland. Greatly abridged it runs as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Loki</i>, the beguiler, flew away one day in quest of
adventures in <i>Frigga’s</i> falcon dress. He flew to a huge
castle over the sea and alighted on a great castle and
looked into the hall. <i>Geirod</i> saw him and ordered him
to be caught. The slave climbed the wall with difficulty
and <i>Loki</i> laughed to see the labor the man made.
He resolved not to fly till the slave had nearly caught
him. He waited too long, as he spread his wings to
mount to the next height and lead on his pursuer, the
slave caught him by the feet and took him to <i>Geirod</i>,
the giant, who, when he looked at him believed him to
be a human and not a real bird. He bade him answer
but <i>Loki</i> was silent. <i>Loki</i> could only regain his liberty
by promising the giant that he would lure <i>Asa
Thor</i> to this fastness without his hammer. <i>Geirod</i>
was sure he could destroy <i>Thor</i> if he could meet him
without <i>Thor</i> having his wonderful hammer. <i>Loki</i>
beguiled <i>Thor</i> to visit <i>Geirod</i> without his hammer; but
a friendly giantess, <i>Grida</i>, Grace, in whose house <i>Thor</i>
lodged, knowing the plot of <i>Loki</i> and <i>Geirod</i>, loaned
<i>Thor</i> her staff and iron gauntlets.”</p>

<p>“<i>Thor</i> discovered the plot and in trying to escape
waded the sea, whereupon <i>Gjálf</i>, (din or roar of
ocean), <i>Geirod’s</i> daughter, flung the waves at <i>Thor</i>.
<i>Thor</i> cast a rock at <i>Gjálf</i> and he never missed when
he cast a stone, and thus with stone hurling and with
the aid of his staff and gauntlets he reached the land.
He caught hold of a friendly ‘rowan’ and climbed out
of the water.”</p>

<p>Because of this myth the mountain ash has ever since
been sacred to <i>Thor</i>.</p>

<p>Again we read:—</p>

<p>“When <i>Thor</i> had won his way into the fire castle,”
(this doubtless refers to the fiery lava chambers which
occur in many parts of Iceland), “he was invited to
take a seat. No sooner had he done so than the seat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
flew to the roof of the hall, where <i>Thor</i> would have
been crushed had he not pushed back with his staff
which the giantess had given him. He pressed back
so effectively that he slew the two water-storm daughters
of <i>Geirod</i>, who had tried to blow him into the
heavens.”</p>

<p>In this parable the reference is undoubtedly to the
<i>Geysir</i>. <i>Thor’s</i> next foe was a volcano.</p>

<p>“<i>Geirod</i> now challenged <i>Thor</i> to fight in the hall
lined with fire. <i>Thor</i> caught the red hot weapons in
his iron gloves and hurled them back to <i>Geirod</i>, who
vainly crouched beside a pillar to defend himself. But
<i>Thor</i> crushed this <i>Demon</i> of <i>Underground Fire</i> back
into the black rock and flung the fire caverns wide open
to the day.”</p>

<p>Such is the ancient legend but it shows how legends
are founded upon facts or conditions, which may be
lost for centuries, though the legends may remain for
us to scoff at when we do not know the foundation. In
this instance we see the forces of water and fire contending
with humans, a never ending contest between the
forces of destruction and the powers of reason and
intelligence.</p>

<p>At the head of the <i>Öxnadalr</i> we stopped at the
post shelter for coffee and cakes and tinned tongue.
The poor little farm is not worthy of the name of a
farm. It is just a bit of mountain herbage at the
borders of the snows and screes and the one family
could not survive were is not for the assistance of the
government in order that a shelter for the post carriers
and chance travellers against the mountain storms
may be provided.</p>

<p>I swapped a pony with the farmer and paid him a
margin of two dollars. The horse I traded was the
same that I had received in a similar trade at <i>Ljósavatn</i>.
The farmer carefully examined the marks in the ears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of the pony and stated that it was raised on this same
farm and had now got home. While I am not a horse
trader and know none of the intricacies of the game
and had no way to learn the Icelandic methods, the
satisfaction I got from this pony convinced me that
the best of the bargain was mine. While the Icelander
is noted for his square dealing and truthfulness I had
often wondered what he would be like in a horse trade.
The pony I traded had a quarter crack and I told
Ólafur to point this out to the farmer. Ólafur shook
his head and said,—</p>

<p>“He can see it as well as you.”</p>

<p>Later I asked Ólafur about this and enquired how
he could reconcile it with the proverbial integrity of
his people. He replied,—</p>

<p>“But this was a horse trade and every man must see
what he is buying when he purchases a horse.”</p>

<p>In connection with this there was another incident of
sharpness that came to my attention in the summer of
1913, though it may have been done more from the
love of a joke than from any intention to defraud.
The Icelander is very fond of a joke, especially when
at the expense of some one else. The steamship company
trading around the coast advertises “to return
<i>empties</i> free of charge.” A farmer in <i>Borg</i> sold a
cow to a man in <i>Reykjavik</i> with the understanding that
the skin was to be returned to him. The man in
<i>Reykjavik</i> tied up the skin and shipped it to the farmer
in <i>Borg</i>. The steamship company charged the farmer
for carrying the bundle. The farmer replied,—</p>

<p>“But there is no charge. You took the cow to Reykjavik
and you offer to return ‘empties free of charge’
and if a cow skin is not an <i>empty</i>, what is it?”</p>

<p>Up and up we climbed to an elevation of about 2,000
feet to the height of land, the watershed between
<i>Skagafjörðr</i>, Cape-Fiord, and <i>Eyjafjörðr</i>. The ride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
down the valley towards the west is wild in the extreme.
The trail passes through a long mountain pasture
where we encountered about one hundred young
ponies, thence along the edge of a chasm so deep that
the tumbling of the water in the bed came up to us only
as a murmur. On our right rose impassable cliffs
and rubble screes and it was along this talus of
rolling material, composed of disintegrating lava
and sand, that we made our way. There are
places where a false step or a small avalanche would
sweep horse and rider into the depths of the chasm.
When the canyon widened, the green-white of the water
flashed up to us like masses of liquid emerald. The
trail improved as we descended and the declivity became
less precipitous; having a long distance ahead of
us we gave the ponies a free bit and away we went in a
joyful gallop down the grade. We had been discussing
the prospects of a tumble a few moments before when
on the edge of the cliff but now all fear had vanished.
My pony stumbled on some small stones and I shot over
his head much to the amusement of my companion.
Mrs. Russell was following at this point. Scarcely had
I regained my seat in the saddle and reined in to the
rear when her pony stumbled and threw her in a similar
manner. She was not hurt. This was my second and
her first tumble during the two summers of riding, so
she held up two fingers to me from time to time. She
was laughing at my poor horsemanship and I pushed
on to the head of the train. A great raven perched on
a lava point was croaking excitedly and it seemed to
me that he said, “saw-you, saw-you, saw-you!” Turning
to look at this fine black bird I saw my brave companion
trying to remount from a second tumble without
letting me know of it. She never forgave that
raven, for if he had not notified me of the mishap she
might still have held those two mocking fingers at me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Rapidly we descended to the lower valley and forded
the rapid river. Ravine after ravine opened into the
valley, each bringing its turbulent stream to swell the
great river far below the trail. We lingered here and
there to examine the rocks and I was surprised at the
outcroppings of copper in the form of copper carbonate.
Zeolites of great beauty are imbedded in the lava and
I have often longed for a day or two to explore some
of those ravines that lead from this pass. There are
indications of considerable copper in two places in Iceland
and since Iceland has unlimited water power for
the electrical treatment of ore some one will soon ascertain
the quantity of copper present.</p>

<p>As the valley became wider it turned towards the
northwest and we caught glimpses of tiny homes on
the opposite side of the river. Desolate homes are
these among the mountains, far away from neighbors.
The farmers eke out a bare living with the produce of
their sheep. Down came the wind in mighty gusts
bringing rain and mists that shut out all distances. The
winds came directly from the ice sheets and as the
clouds shut out the sun the rain soon turned to a
driving sleet. We were tired, cold and hungry and
thoroughly in need of shelter. The top of a tiny spire
showed itself through the mist below and I thought,
“<i>Miklebaer</i> at last.” Ólafur dashed our hopes by saying
that this farm with its excellent buildings and its
hospitable pastor was two hours ride beyond the metal
church below us. He urged us forward but I refused
as it was not possible to ride further, except in a case of
life or death. So we reined into the <i>tún of Silfrastaðir</i>,
Silver-Stead, and while we were dismounting a man,
blind with age, tottered towards us on his cane and extended
his trembling hand and in the Saga phrase, “he
greeted us well.” That little tumbled down home in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the mountain pass, that small bed in a cupboard in
the wall, how good they looked to us! That Icelandic
welcome! We had received it on the prosperous farms
and in the city, yes in the more favored portions of
the land, even in the home of the Governor, but never
before, never since, has any abode seemed so pleasant
and all other welcomes at home and abroad shrink in
value when compared with the welcome and the cordial
hospitality of this poor blind man of <i>Silfrastaðir</i>, who
gave us the best he had and bade us “God speed” on
the morrow.</p>

<p>During the night our ponies ran away and it was a
long time before Ólafur found them. They were going,
according to their habit, before the wind and were
nearly down to <i>Miklebaer</i> when the guide found them.
While he was pony hunting I repaired to the little
kitchen, if such it may be called, and over a fire of dried
sheep manure made some coffee and with the provisions
in our packing boxes we made a good breakfast. We
got away at ten thirty and soon after noon arrived at
<i>Miklebaer</i> and turned into the <i>tún</i> enclosure to visit
the grave of Frederick W. W. Howell, F. R. G. S.
Howell was the author of the Pen Pictures of Iceland.
He had spent many summers in the country and knew
it the best of any Englishman. His illustrations are
works of art and his descriptions of natural scenery
are faithful and full of appreciation. Howell was the
first to make the ascent of the <i>Öraefa Jökull</i>, 6,400
feet in height and the highest peak in Iceland. This
was in August 1891. He lost his life in fording the
<i>Heraðsvötn</i>, District-Waters, a broad, swift and deep
river which flows through the valley of the <i>Skagafjörðr</i>.
The place was opposite the farm of <i>Miklebaer</i>. This
farm belongs to the church and within its cemetery the
unfortunate Englishman is buried. A marble memorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
marks his resting place and bears the following inscription:—</p>

<p class="center">In Loving Memory<br />

Who Was Called to His Rest<br />
From the Heraðsvötn River<br />

“Asleep in Jesus, Oh What Rest!<br />

<p>The pastor invited us into his study and refreshed us
with coffee and cakes and conversed with us in German
and broken English. He had a good library of English,
German and Icelandic works. Our stay was longer
than we intended, for Ólafur, (this time it was a young
lady and not the ponies that caused the delay), found
a fair maiden of pleasing conversation. We finally
started without the guide and later when he had overtaken
us at the fiord and I teased him about his tardiness
he stated that the maiden asked him to wait while she
wrote a letter to a friend of hers in <i>Reykjavik</i> and
requested him to be the messenger. It must have been
a long letter. Had he collected as long a letter from
each of the attractive maidens at the many farms where
we called in the summer of 1910 he would have had a
good sized mail by the time he reached the capital.</p>

<p>On arrival at the ferry we found a good boat into
which we loaded four of the ponies at a time with the
packing cases. It was here that we met the venerable
poet, <i>Matthias Jochumsson</i>. Remounting we crossed
a wonderfully rich grass plain. It is in this valley that
the best ponies of Iceland are bred. Later in the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
we arrived at <i>Viðimýri</i>, Wide-Bog. Here we were
fortunate in witnessing a pony-fair at which hundreds
of ponies changed hands. They are gathered from the
mountains for sale to the exporters and it is here that
the Icelandic gentleman comes for his private saddle
pony.</p>

<p>Steadily we climbed the mountain in a driving wind
with some rain. The wind blew cold from off the
<i>Skagafjörðr</i>, Cape-Fiord. The ocean was clear and
an excellent view was had of <i>Drangey</i>, Lonely-Island.
It was on this island that <i>Grettir</i>, the Strong, the favorite
hero of Iceland, met his death at the hands of
his enemies. He had been an outlaw for many years.
Sometimes he made his home in the lava waste between
<i>Hoffs Jökull</i> and <i>Láng Jökull</i>. I visited the cave in
1913 which is marked by several cairns. At one time
he lived at <i>Arnavatn</i>, Eagle-Lake and at another he
dwelt in the remote fastness of <i>Thórisdalr</i> at the south
end of <i>Láng Jökull</i>. In the summer of 1913 I went
to the entrance to this fastness. It is the finest retreat
for an outlaw that any country could possibly provide
in its natural configurations. The <i>Saga of Grettir</i>
relates that he found his way over the lava wastes of
<i>Skjalbreith</i>, Broad-Shield, by sighting the summit of
<i>Skjalbreith</i> through a hole in a block of lava and noting
the intervening points of prominence. In the old days
the youth of Iceland used to assemble on the level grass
plain at the extreme northern end of <i>Thingvellir</i> during
the annual meeting of the <i>Althing</i> to hold their sports.
At one time <i>Grettir</i> came down from <i>Thórisdalr</i> in
disguise and entered into the wrestling. One by one
he threw all the champions from the different sections
of Iceland and did it with apparent ease. The maidens
sat upon the high conglomerate knob overlooking the
plain and saw with sorrow their respective favorites
beaten in the feats of strength. The seat upon which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
they sat is known as <i>Meijarsoeti</i>, Maidens’-Seat. It
was not till <i>Grettir</i> left the arena and climbed the
narrow pass which runs upward beside <i>Meijarsoeti</i> that
it was discovered that the unknown wrestler was in
truth <i>Grettir</i>, though some of the wise ones had hinted
as much.</p>

<p>The story of <i>Grettir’s</i> life on <i>Drangey</i> is of great interest
but too long for a full recital. If the reader desires
to know more of the real hero of Iceland in the
old days and the one most often mentioned at the present
time he should read the <i>Grettir Saga</i>. It will give
an account of his wanderings, his conflict with the ghost
and his harder struggles with the men who desired to
take his life because he had refused to leave his native
land after the Althing had outlawed him with the
greater outlawry. <i>Drangey</i> is an island in the middle
of the great fiord and the sides are so steep that it
is possible to ascend only at one place. With two men
he took up his abode here and lived upon the sheep
which the farmers had put upon the rock for summer
pasture. The <i>Saga</i> relates that on a Christmas night
his fire went out and that he swam to the mainland
to replenish it. He entered the house by the shore and
was recognized by an old woman. Several men, the
foes of <i>Grettir</i>, were making merry in an adjoining
room, but the old woman pitied him and, because it
was Christmas night, gave him the coals and allowed
him to depart in peace. Placing the fire in a small
kettle, he swam back to <i>Drangey</i> and rekindled the
fire in his stone stove.</p>

<p>The temperature was only three degrees above freezing
when we descended the western slope of the mountain
and arrived at the farm, <i>Bolstaðarhlið</i>, Wood-Farm-Slope.
There was a long delay in getting supper but
it came at last in the shape of a hot lamb stew and we
were provided with comfortable beds. We were told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
that in the morning we could have oatmeal porridge,
and, since it had been many days that we had had
anything of this nature, we looked forward with pleasure
to the breakfast. Having a long ride before us on
the morrow, we solemnly arranged with Ólafur to
start by eight-thirty. He agreed to have the ponies and
the cases in readiness. We had often held these solemn
councils but a stray pony, a broken pack saddle, a
lost shoe or some other quite common mishap had always
prevented our starting before one to three hours
after the appointed time. This morning it was not the
fault of Ólafur and there were none of the usual causes
of delay. It was that oatmeal porridge and even the
placid guide was disturbed at the delay. Well, at ten
we sat down to enjoy that oatmeal with real thick,
sweet cream in abundance. The combination was delicious
as the oatmeal was thoroughly cooked. Then,
I pulled out a long black hair and carefully concealed
the presence of it from my companion. Soon I found
another and this one was white. I could no longer refrain
from communicating my discoveries and so I
stated:—</p>

<p>“I have discovered exactly how long this oatmeal
was cooked.”</p>

<p>“Well, how long was it cooked and why this smile?”</p>

<p>I replied,—“The woman who started to prepare
this porridge had black hair, but when she had finished
it her hair had turned white.”</p>

<p>After a short ride we came to the <i>Blandá</i>, Mingled-Waters,
which was so swollen that it was necessary for
us to proceed to the mouth of the river at <i>Blönduós</i>
where there is a substantial bridge. The ride from this
trading village south to the farm, <i>Hnausar</i>, Rough-Ground,
was in a hard rain with the thermometer at
one degree above freezing and with occasional gusts
of snow that swept down from the ridge at our right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
with the howling wind. With our heads bowed low
over the saddle and the wind at our backs we saw
little of the valley save that at the feet of the ponies.
The wind increased and the storm drove up the valley
from the Arctic Ocean with sufficient violence to drive
from our minds everything save thoughts of a shelter.
At seven-thirty we halted at the gate of the <i>tún</i> while
Ólafur sought the <i>bondé</i> to ask the customary questions
about food, shelter and grass for the ponies. I
have never had the request refused but politeness demands
that the traveller remain without the turf wall
until the request is made of the farmer, or if he is
absent, of his wife or oldest son. The Icelander within
his turf wall is like a baron in his castle and as such
must be recognized. Once the questions are asked the
request is granted and the traveller then is placed at
ease with all the freedom that is necessary.</p>

<p>The good wife built a fire of turf and sheep manure
in the tall Norwegian stove in the guest room, took
all our wet clothing to her kitchen to dry and prepared
for us a satisfying and tasty supper. She kept the fire
replenished till midnight and I remember no fire that
seemed so good as this one. Before the fire was built
and we stood about the cold stove with chattering teeth
I knew something of how <i>Grettir</i> felt when he discovered
that all his coals had turned to ashes out there
on <i>Drangey</i>.</p>

<p>It rained and snowed by turns all night and at eleven
when I looked out upon the farm the haycocks wore
white capes. A small bedroom opened out of the guest
room and the water came through its turf roof in many
places in streams, in fact everywhere except upon the
bed and why that was exempt I do not know.</p>

<p>The morning broke cold and windy with falling snow
and the uncut grass protruded its emerald green
through the white blanket. We looked towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
south, listened to the gusty wind, glanced at the lowering
heavens and returned to the heated stove. It was
Sunday and we decided to let the ponies have a day
of rest. They, poor beasts, were not grazing but stood
with drooping heads and tails turned towards the wind.
The ponies of Iceland! In no other place in the world
will horses thrive under such treatment as they receive
in this land. They are ridden or driven with their
heavy packs all day, often upon grassless mountain
slopes, fording deep and cold rivers, often swimming,
often laboring in long reaches of sand or plunging in
grassy bogs. When the work of the day is finished
they are simply turned adrift to care for themselves.
They are never groomed, never given any grain, never
covered with a blanket; they have no sheltering stalls.
They are simply turned loose in the storm as well as in
the sunshine, or, into what they dread worse than any
storm, among the swarms of savage midges. When
the grass is good they are happy; they never knew any
other life. What steed of English or American stables
would care to become an Icelandic pony, to work all
day for the chance to graze all night, and then, as I
have so often witnessed, have their master end the days
work in a dreary sand waste where willow leaves and
scanty sedges offer the only forage?</p>

<p>The day passed rapidly and pleasantly. The farmer
came to our sitting room to take coffee with us at noon
and then invited me to go and see his pet saddle horse,
a magnificent stallion. This I did with interest as I
had never seen a stallion among the thousands of ponies
I had found in the country. He saddled him and
showed his different paces for some time about the tún
and then Ólafur was invited to ride him. I photographed
the farmer on his steed and then I was invited
to ride the stallion. It is a mark of special favor for
any farmer to allow another to mount his private pony;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and it is also a breach of etiquette to offer to mount another’s
pony. This is a custom that clings from the
pagan days. We read in the <i>Saga of Hrafnkell, Frey’s
Priest</i>, how one man met his death by mounting the
favorite horse of another. The story is as follows, but
greatly abbreviated:—</p>

<p>Einarr engaged himself to watch the sheep of the
Priest of Frey, <i>Hrafnkell</i>, and his master said to
him:—</p>

<p>“I’ll make a short bargain with thee. Thy business
shall be to watch fifteen ewes at the mountain dairy and
gather and carry home faggots for summer fuel. On
these terms thou shalt take service with me for two
‘half-years.’ But one thing must I give thee, as all my
shepherds to understand,—‘Freymane’ goes grazing in
the valley with his band of mares; thou shalt take care
of him winter and summer, but I warn thee of one
thing, namely, that thou never be on his back on any
condition whatever, for I am bound by a mighty vow
to slay the man that ever should have a ride on him.
There are twelve mares with him; whichever one of
these thou mayest want, night or day, is at your service.
Do now as I tell thee and mind the old saw,—‘No
blame is borne by those who warn.’ Now thou knowest
that I have said.”</p>

<p>Einarr replied:—“I trust I am under no such luckless
spell as to ride on a horse which is forbidden,
least of all when there are other horses at my disposal.”</p>

<p>Briefly, Einarr went to work, the time came when
the sheep wandered; a rain and mist came down; the
ewes had been absent many days; Einarr went down
to the grass where the mares were grazing taking his
saddle cloth and bridle, thinking to catch one and ride
over the hills in search of the lost sheep. He could
not catch one of the mares though he had spent all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
morning; but “Freymane was as quiet as if stuck buried
in the ground.” Einarr though that his master surely
would never know, so he mounted the forbidden pony
and “rode until middle eve,” and “he rode him long
and hard.” “The horse was all dripping even every
hair on him; bespattered he was all over with mire, and
mightily blown. Twelve times he rolled himself, and
then he set up a mighty neighing, and then set off at a
quick pace down along the beaten track.” … “Einarr
ran after him but could not lay hand on him.” …
“He ran all the way along the valley never stopping
till he came to <i>Aðalból</i>. At that time Hrafnkell sat at
table, and when the horse came before the door it
neighed aloud.”</p>

<p>“He went out and saw Freymane and spoke to him;
‘I am sorry to see thee in this kind of a plight, my pet;
however thou hadst all thy wits about thee in coming
thus to let me know what was the matter; due revenge
shall be taken for this.’”</p>

<p>“In the morning <i>Hrafnkell</i> saddled a horse and rode
up to the dairy; he had his axe in his hand but no other
weapons about him. At this time <i>Einarr</i> had just
driven the ewes into the pen, and lay on the top of the
wall counting the sheep; but the women were busy milking.
They all greeted <i>Hrafnkell</i> and he asked how
they got on. <i>Einarr</i> answered; ‘I have no good speed
myself, for no less than thirty ewes were missing for
a week, though now I have found them again.’ Hrafnkell
said he had no fault to find with things of that kind,
‘it has not happened so often as might have been expected
that thou hast lost the ewes. But has not something
worse befallen than that? Didst thou not have
a ride on Freymane yesterday?’</p>

<p>“<i>Einarr</i> replied,—‘I can not gainsay that utterly.’”</p>

<p>“Why didst thou ride on this one horse which was
forbidden thee, while there were plenty of others on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
which thou art free to ride? Now this one trespass I
could have forgiven thee, if I had not used words of
such great earnestness already. And yet thou hast manfully
confessed thy guilt.”</p>

<p>“But by reason of the belief that those who fulfill
their vows never come to grief, he leaped off his horse,
sprang upon <i>Einarr</i>, and dealt him his death blow.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon the Doctor from <i>Blönduós</i> arrived
at the farm to pay a social call and the farmer brought
him to our sitting room, while the eldest daughter
served us with the usual social beverage in Iceland.
Two pleasant hours passed during which we gained
much information about Icelandic customs, local history
and legends.</p>

<p>The rain came down still harder in the evening but
we welcomed it as it promised warmer weather and
bare ground on the morrow. So much water had come
into our bed room that it was only by judicious side
stepping and walking on the tops of the packing boxes
that we were able to reach the bed without a cold and
muddy footbath.</p>

<p>There are three things in Iceland that have never
been counted:—The islands in <i>Breiðifjörðr</i>, Broad-Fiord,
the lakes of <i>Arnavatnsheiði</i>, Eagle-Lake-Heath,
and the conical hills of <i>Vatnsdalr</i>, Water-Dale. Our
stopping place, <i>Hnausar</i>, which signifies rough ground,
is in the midst of these peculiar hills and in the center
of the valley. We spent three days among the hills and
found them of marked interest to the geologist. Hundreds
of acres are covered with the cones rising from
the plain to an elevation of from twenty-five to over
one hundred feet. Oftentimes they are so near together
that their bases are confluent and thus seem to
be double peaked in a few instances. Geologists have
given different reasons for this queer formation. One
states that they are of glacial origin and were left when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the ice melted in the form of moraines; another is of
the opinion that they are the results of great avalanches
upon the glacier, which in melting left them here. Another
states that they are merely the weathered fragments
of a local lava flow. I spent a day in their examination
and so will give my reasons for rejecting the
causes assigned by these gentlemen and substitute my
own conclusions in order that future scientists interested
in the geology of Iceland may confirm or refute according
as they weigh the evidence.</p>

<p>They can not be glacial moraine as there is no evidence
of any glacial action in any way upon any of the
fragments and it must be remembered that as compared
with glaciated areas in other lands Icelandic glaciation
is as if it occurred yesterday. In fact glaciers
are still covering many square miles of the table land.
There is no evidence of any water erosion on any of
the stones. They could not have been avalanches upon
the ice sheet for there are no mountains near at hand
from which such masses of material could have come.
And if it is argued that the avalanches were at a distance
it turns the problem once more into that of the
moraine. The character of the valley and its low mountains
will not permit our reason to accept either the
glacial or the avalanche theory.</p>

<p>There is no evidence of any great lava flow either
in plugs, intrusive sheets or surface flow, neither in the
necessary abundance of scoriae and blistered fragments
to warrant such a theory. And if there were, we must
then explain why these are “cones” and <i>not craters</i> with
blistered rims and solid slopes. We must turn to
<i>Mývatn</i> for the explanation. It is my opinion that
deep seated and violent subterranean explosions of
considerable frequency took place here, as in the case
of <i>Hverfjall</i> the giant explosion crater of <i>Mývatn</i>. It
heaved up the crust in crumpled masses, mingling the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
different basalt formations of ancient flows which lay in
superimposed sheets. How else can one account for the
many kinds of lava in a single cone, the absence of
blistering and cones in place of craters? I have performed
an interesting experiment in the laboratory upon
this theory and with results that seem to verify the
above conclusions. A two liter copper beaker was
chosen. It was half filled with clay dust of different
colors in layers. This dust was prepared by thoroughly
drying the clays, pulverizing and then dusting it through
a double fold of cheese cloth. This gave me particles
large enough for my miniature experiment. The beaker
was then slowly heated from the bottom. After due
process of time with the increase of heat the subterranean
gases, in this case air in the dust, expanded. At
first with slightly audible bumps and a faint trembling
of the surface. These increased until the action became
violent and small mounds were thrown up which
formed true cones with mingled colors from the different
depths.</p>

<p><i>Vatnsdalr</i> is a fair and pleasant valley, when the
sun shines. No wonder that it possessed a charm for the
early settlers with its parallel mountain ridges of entrancing
blue, its noble river expanding into fine sheets
of water where trout are abundant and its fertile meadows
of broad expanse. It is historic ground as well as
legendary. It has known stirring days and its heroes
were the bravest of any who wielded the axe and bill
in the troublesome times when blood alone could recompense
a personal affront or a crossed lover. A
whole sheaf of <i>Sagas</i> relate the deeds of the men and
women of Waterdale. The valley is the same as of
old. The inhabitants point out the exact localities
where the guest halls of the nobles stood and where
their temples of sacrifice were reared to propitiate the
gods of Valhalla; they show one where the champions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
battled for their rights, where the lovers held their
trysts and the mounds where the heroes were entombed.
These incidents have been handed down from generation
to generation, from father to son and the stories
were oft repeated in the <i>bathstófa</i> during the long winter
evenings when the Arctic shore was frozen and the
wind whirled the drifting snows around their turf huts.</p>

<p>Besides the lengthy <i>Sagas</i> there are numerous shorter
stories that have been preserved in written form such
as that of <i>Gisli</i>, the Outlaw; <i>Grettir</i>, the Strong and
<i>Glum</i>. It is a knowledge of the <i>Sagas</i> and the legends
that spread the charm over this valley, that leads one
from the present to the past by a jump backwards of
many centuries. To visit Iceland, especially the <i>Saga
Dales</i>, in ignorance of their history would be like tramping
through Scotland without any acquaintance with
Sir Walter Scott, or a sojourn in London without a
knowledge of Dickens.</p>

<p>In most countries the progress of modern life, with
its inventions and the eternal scramble for the latest
style in everything, has obliterated much if not all of
the past and one can only obtain the colors of the
former ages in the ruins of a castle or cathedral or
from the written pages of the antiquary. Not so in Iceland,—farms,
mountains, rivers, lakes and meadows remain
the same and under the same names given to them
by the first settlers, though it be ten centuries of time.
No railway or canal, no public improvements, modern
cities or factories have obliterated the ancient landmarks.
Even the manners and dress of the people are
little changed from that early day. On the ruins of the
tumbled-down hut of his grandfather the grandson
erects his house in the same fashion and the descendants
of the first imported sheep furnish skins for shoes
still tanned, cut and fashioned after the ancient model.
To visit the remote dales of Iceland is to be set backward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
in history and fashions a thousand years.</p>

<p>The <i>Waterdale Saga</i> tells us how <i>Ingmundr</i>, a grand
old Viking, after years of sea-roving and plundering
along the shores of the southern seas settled in this valley
with his followers. He had made a vow that no
matter where he might roam that Norway should always
remain his home. The witches of Finland prophesied
that Iceland would be his resting place and so it
was. At the farm called <i>Hof</i>, Temple, one may still
trace the position of his great <i>Scali</i>, Banquet Hall, and
there beside it winds the river where the old man lost
his life. He had promised protection to a renegade
who treacherously slew his benefactor. <i>Ingmundr</i> went
to his high seat in the hall after the blow, wrapped his
cloak around him and died alone. His grandson,
<i>Ingólfr</i>, was “the handsomest man in all the northern
lands.” Here is a song written about him over 800
years ago by a little maiden who admired him:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>In the <i>Saga</i> of the farm of <i>Grimstunga</i>, Grim’s
Tongue, (<i>tunga</i> is frequently used with reference to a
narrow strip of grass land in a sand waste or between
masses of lava), at the head of the valley, we find the
following story of <i>Ingólfr</i>:—</p>

<p>“An autumn feast was held at <i>Grimstunga</i> and a
playing at the ball. <i>Ingólfr</i> came to the game, and
many men with him from the Dale,” (Water Dale.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
“The weather was fine and the women sat out and
watched the game. <i>Valgerðr</i>, <i>Ottar’s</i> daughter, sat
on the hill-side and other women with her. <i>Ingólfr</i>
was in the game and his ball flew far up among the
girls. <i>Valgerðr</i> took the ball and hid it under her
cloak and bade him find it who had cast it. <i>Ingólfr</i>
came up and found it and bade the others go on with
the game; but he played no more himself. He sat
down by <i>Valgerðr</i> and talked the rest of the day.”</p>

<p>It was the story of love that did not go smoothly for
he flirted and did not propose to her father for her hand
in marriage. Her father sold his farm and moved to
the south. Man-slayings followed and <i>Valgerðr</i> was
forced by her father to marry another man when <i>Ingólfr</i>
deserted her for another maiden. He had many love
affairs for he was inconstant. In the end he was
wounded by outlaws and when dying he requested that
he might be laid in the mound with his forefathers near
the river path in Water Dale that “the maidens might
remember him when they walked that way.”</p>

<p><i>Valgerðr</i> had a famous brother, <i>Halfreðr</i> nicknamed
<i>Vandaeðaskald</i>, signifying the “Troublesome Scald.”
He was the favorite <i>scald</i> of the powerful Norwegian
King, <i>Olaf Tryggvason</i>, who reigned from 995 to
1000 A. D. A full account of this King and of his
favorite singer is given in <i>Heimskringla</i> by <i>Snorri
Sturlason</i>, the Norse Historian, from which the following
brief account is condensed.</p>

<p><i>Halfreðr</i> was a wayward youth, given to wandering
and adventure, a real Viking in spirit. He was born
in 968 and raised at this very farm of <i>Haukagil</i>, Hawk-Gulley,
where the notes for this chapter were roughly
penned in 1910. He was “a tall man, strong and
manly looking, somewhat swarthy, his nose rather ugly,
his hair brown and setting him off well.”</p>

<p>A little brook tumbles down from the heath behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the house, the rolling meadow reaches away to the river
and beyond it the mountains rise in glorious colors in
this evening light just as they did when <i>Halfreðr</i> played
beside this same brook as a child and <i>Ingólfr</i> flirted
with <i>Halfreðr’s</i> sister. The turf house and the <i>tún</i>, the
noisy dogs bringing up the ewes for the evening milking,
the swish of the scythe in the grass and the call
of the plover on the heights,—all are as in the days of
old and it requires little fancy to place this sturdy youth
in his old surroundings.</p>

<p>He was a poetical genius, a favorite of kings and a
terror to his enemies. He did not so often unsheath
his sword in a quarrel as he employed his stinging
rhymes which cut his enemy deeper than the sharpest
sword. Like his sister, <i>Halfreðr</i> had his love troubles.
<i>Kolfina</i> loved him and he reciprocated but her father
chose otherwise and betrothed her to <i>Griss</i>, a man who
had accumulated great wealth in the service of the Emperor
at Constantinople. <i>Griss</i> was “rather elderly,
short-sighted, blear-eyed;” but he could see well enough
when he went to woo <i>Kolfina</i> that a handsome youth
was kissing her at the door of the lodge. Caught by
<i>Griss</i> in the very act, <i>Halfreðr</i> shouted to him as he
took his reluctant departure:—</p>

<p>“Thou shalt have me for a foe, <i>Griss</i>, if thou wilt
try to make this match.”</p>

<p>The parents gave <i>Halfreðr</i> a good scolding and ordered
him away at once. As he rides away he makes
this rhyme:—</p>

<div class="verse indent10">“Halfred the scald,</div>
<div class="verse">Gray-bearded, wrinkled, and bald.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This passage shows the wide poetic license which
Longfellow took in dealing with the <i>Sagas</i> and the
<i>Heimskringla</i> of <i>Snorri</i>. Scott’s harpers were always
old and gray and Longfellow infers that the Scalds
were the same. The fact is that <i>Halfreðr</i> did not live
beyond forty years of age. He was gay and reckless
as were all of his cult; he was reckless of speech even
in the presence of the king. He was always ready with
a song whether at the court of <i>Olaf</i>, in the camp, on
the sea in storm or in calm or in the brunt of the
fight. He was constant in love and although he married
a beautiful and wealthy woman he never forgot
his early love for the fair <i>Kolfina</i>.</p>

<p>King <i>Olaf</i> had much trouble in converting him to
Christianity and in getting him to take the christening.
He succeeded as we shall see from the following quotation,
but <i>Halfreðr</i> clung in secret to the faith of his fathers,
the hope of a future life in <i>Valhalla</i> as we note
from the many references to the old northern gods in
his songs and the way in which he talks of them. So
frequently did he call upon the pagan deities that <i>Olaf</i>
often talked to him about it and mistrusted that he was
not really converted to the Cross.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>The Christening of Halfred The Troublous-Skald.</h3>

<p class="center">Heimskringla, Vol. I. <i>Sturlason</i>.</p>

<p>“On a day went the King a-walking in the street, and
certain men met him, and he of them who went first
greeted the King; and the King asked him of his name,
and he named himself <i>Hallfreðr</i>.”</p>

<p>“Art thou the skald?” said the king.</p>

<p>Said he, “I can make verses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>Then said the King:—“Wilt thou take christening,
and become my man thereafter?”</p>

<p>Saith he:—“This shall be our bargain: I will let
myself be christened, if thou, King, be thyself my gossip,
but from no other man will I take it.”</p>

<p>The King answerest:—“Well, I will do that.”</p>

<p>So then was <i>Hallfreðr</i> christened, and the King himself
held him at the font.</p>

<p>Then the King asked of <i>Hallfreðr</i>: “Wilt thou now
become my man?”</p>

<p><i>Hallfreðr</i> said: “Erst was I of the body-guard of
Earl <i>Hakon</i>; nor will I now be the liege man of thee
nor of any other lord, but if thou give me thy word
that for no deed I may happen to do thou wilt drive me
away from thee.”</p>

<p>“From all that is told me,” said the King, “thou
art neither so wise nor so meek but it seemeth like
enough to me that thou mayest do some deed or other
which I may nowise put up with.”</p>

<p>“Slay me then,” said <i>Hallfreðr</i>.</p>

<p>The King said: “Thou art a Troublous-Skald; but
my man shalt thou be now.”</p>

<p>Answereth <i>Hallfreðr</i>: “What wilt thou give me for
a name gift, King, if I am to be called Troublous-Scald?”</p>

<p>The King gave him a sword, but no scabbard therewith;
and the King said: “Make us now a stave about
the sword, and let the <i>sword</i> come into every line.”</p>

<p><i>Hallfreðr</i> sang:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“One only sword of all swords</div>
<div class="verse">Hath made me now sword-wealthy</div>
<div class="verse">Now then shall things be sword-some</div>

<div class="verse">Naught to the sword were lacking,</div>
<div class="verse">If to that sword were scabbard</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the King gave him the scabbard and said:
“But there is not a sword in every line.”</p>

<p>“Yea,” answers <i>Hallfreðr</i>, “but there are <i>three</i>
swords in one line.”</p>

<p>“Yea, forsooth,” saith the King.</p>

<p>Now from <i>Hallfreðr’s</i> songs we take knowledge and
sooth witness from what is there told concerning King
<i>Olaf</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1014, after a great sea fight in which a yard arm
fell and inflicted a mortal blow, <i>Hallfreðr</i> lay dying on
board of a crippled vessel which was drifting before
the gale. Still mindful of conditions around him he
makes the following stave, which was translated by
Miss <i>Oswald</i>:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">And the sea is aboard our craft,</div>
<div class="verse">And nowhere the scald can rest.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With his dying breath he chanted the following
stave, showing that his early love, <i>Kolfina</i>, had not
been forgotten during his long years of warfare and
wanderings:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Thus died in middle life one of the greatest of the
Norse scalds. His had been a “troublous” life indeed.
The duties of the scald were to improvise poetry on
the instant, in praise of the King and in recounting the
deeds of his favorite warriors in battle. He was the
historian and the periodical at the same time; his utterances
were respected and he was feared by prince and
peasant. The scald had liberties at court and in the
royal camp or on board the royal fighting ship not
accorded to any other retainer.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The present house at <i>Haukagill</i> is finished
inside with unpainted spruce from Norway,
beautiful as old mahogany, having become
soft reddish brown with age and frequent
polishing with fine sand. Our bed chamber contained
the pride of the family, a Connecticut clock adjusted to
strike the hours and the quarters. Its gong was far
from musical. The bells of Bruges had raised havoc
with our sleep with their persistent struggle to be heard,
but this clock, on a shelf at the head of the bed, reminded
us every fifteen minutes that it also came from
New England as well as we and was clamorous for
recognition. After hours of sleeplessness we wished
it had never left the Nutmeg State.</p>

<p>At nine in the morning we turned our backs upon
this charming valley, climbed the steep hill and looked
down at the farm house, the last we were to see for
two days. We were now fairly upon the great plain
of <i>Grimstungaheiði</i>, Grim’s-Tongue-Heath, an extensive
tract of desolation between the fertile valleys of
the north and the glaciers of the great central plateau
of Iceland. For a while there was a trace of a trail
which soon disappeared. Hour after hour we plodded
on, guided solely by the glimmer of the glaciers on the
horizon and an occasional tumbled-down cairn of
former days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>This tract is a broad and fresh moraine from the
recently receded glacier, chaotic, empty, vast and dreary.
There is nothing to relieve the monotony of the scene
save the increasing mass of ice as the glaciers loom
higher above the stony horizon. The angular fragments
of lava, somber, gray, variously riven and confusedly
hurled in piles, are as though some vast mountain
had been crumpled like an eggshell and the fragments
scattered by a titanic hand. No touch of verdure
enlivens the cold ruin and weary waste, save at the
margins of the numerous ponds and pools which glimmer
like sheets of light in the dim distance. Otherwise,
everything everywhere is like everything everywhere
else. This heath is similar to the vast interior of Iceland,
except that the traces of vegetation found here
are often entirely wanting throughout large sections,
notably north of <i>Hoffs Jökull</i>, as my pack train had occasion
to testify in the summer of 1913. There are
large sections of bristling lava, life-destroying sands
and death-presaging glaciers which man has never explored.</p>

<p>All day we rode to the southward, and, save the
wild swan on the ponds, no living creature crossed our
trail. It was three in the afternoon before we found
sufficient grass to afford the hungry ponies a bite; this
was at the margin of a pool of glacial water that had
filtered through the moraines. We regaled ourselves
from the contents of our packing boxes, rested an hour,
changed saddle horses and then pushed on over an unusually
rough mass of terminal moraine at the foot of
<i>Láng Jökull</i>. We turned towards the southwest,
crossed a bog and arrived at the small <i>saelhus</i>, refuge,
at <i>Arnavatn</i>, Eagle-Lake. This shelter of turf and
stones was built for the protection of the sheep gatherers,
who resort hither in the autumn to gather the sheep
that have strayed to the highlands during the long
summer.</p>

<p>This shelter stands on the shore of the lake just
under the shoulder of <i>Eyriks Jökull</i>. As this was one
of the most unusual so was it the choicest of our experiences
this summer. In front of the hut is a waterfall
which connects the upper with the lower lake.
Here upon this point of land <i>Grettir</i> lived for many
years during his exile, six I believe. In ancient days
this desert was infested with outlaws, desperate men,
living upon sheep and cattle stolen from the farmers
along the borders of the desert. Usually these were
men who had taken human life and were ready to take
others if it would secure to them their wild liberty.
Considering the history of the place, its rough and
weird aspect, its proximity to the life-destroying glaciers
and the chaos so heavily stamped upon the land, it
is not to be wondered that imagination has peopled
this unfrequented area with trolls and witches, nor
that a few people may be found to-day who tell their
children that outlaws still live in the interior around
the glaciers and in the lava caves.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1913 I was camping at <i>Hvitávatn</i>,
White-Lake, on the east side of <i>Láng Jökull</i> with the
same Icelander, Ólafur Eyvindsson, who was with us in
1910. He said that he first visited White-Lake in 1909
and that after he had retired with another Icelander to
their tent which was beside that of Mr. and Mrs. Frederick
Wright of Washington, D. C., they were thinking
about the outlaws and Ólafur wondered if there was
really any truth in the current stories of outlaws living
here at the present time. At the close of conversation
when sleep had fallen upon him, he awoke as with
the sound of two men talking in a low tone in the
Icelandic. He cautiously put his head out of the tent
and with something like fear. He listened a few moments,
the men drew nearer and he went to meet them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>To his pleasant surprise he found them to be a well
known physician and his friend from <i>Reykjavik</i>. And
this is all the truth there is to-day about outlaws in the
interior of Iceland. There is only one thing to fear,—shortage
of grass for the ponies. Grass the pony must
have and feeding it to him is like feeding shavings
to a roaring furnace. It is a rare sight to see an Icelandic
pony lying down, for he will carry you all day
and feed all night.</p>

<p>During the evening Ólafur and I shod the ponies, for
the rough blocks had made havoc with their little feet.
This was my first experience in the art of farriery. We
hobbled them for the night and turned them into the
bog beside the upper pond. Then we made great inroads
upon our provisions. We gathered a few fragments
of birch twigs and roots and some dried sheep
manure and with this fuel were able to warm two cans
of soup and to smoke the hut thoroughly. The smoke
had the wholesome effect of driving out the dampness.</p>

<p>That evening is long to live in memory. We were
fortunate in having no fog and a perfectly clear atmosphere.
The vastness of the lava-riven plain, rolling
away to the distant mountains, the network of
ponds and glacial streams, glimmering in the lingering
sunlight of the Arctic summer night, the great glacier,
with blue-green walls and prismic domes, upon whose
front hung scores of streams like strings of shining
pearls,—such was the framework of the picture. The
smoke from our root fire curled lazily upwards into
the clear and rarified air from the diminutive pile of
turf and lava that was to be our shelter for the night.
The swan led their young from lake to lake in front
of the camp and sang throughout the glorious night.</p>

<p>The hardness of the improvised bed of boards and
saddles, or, perhaps it was the charm of the landscape,
forbade my lengthened morning slumber and three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
o’clock found me crouched in the shelter of the cairn,
drinking in the wonders of the scene,—glacier, lake
and rolling moraine with the sunlight over all.</p>

<p>Eight in the morning, breakfastless, found us in the
saddle. The ponies had fared poorly here, and if we
were not to spend another night in the desert we must
ride until we found grass, where pony and man could
eat to repletion.</p>

<p>The heath over which we took our morning ride is
uninviting, dreary and somewhat awe inspiring. There
are many beds of flowers in sheltered places. The purple
armaria, sandwort and stone-crop are the smiles of
Flora upon the face of an Arctic desolation. As one
reclines upon the flowered mounds between the tussocks
of grass, basking in the genial sunshine and piling the
empty tins around him, he forgets for the moment that
he is under the cliffs of a mighty sheet of perpetual ice,
that he is entirely dependent upon his ponies and the
scanty grass they are now so greedily eating. Breakfast
over, we rode for hours under the front of <i>Eyriks
Jökull</i>, with many a stony moraine to climb and glacial
torrent to ford. There is a legend concerning the
name of this mountain which is worth relating as it
shows something of the stirring times of the old days
in spite of the absurdity of the conclusion.</p>

<p>A band of outlaws assembled in the great cavern of
<i>Surtur</i> and lived upon ponies, sheep and cattle stolen
from the farmers near <i>Kalmungstúnga</i>, Kalmungs-Tongue,
and became a great menace to the entire region.
Many attempts had been made to capture them
but without avail. Finally a lad volunteered to leave
his home and join the outlaws and act in the capacity
of a spy. He did his work so well that he won the
full confidence of the outlaws for he killed sheep belonging
to his own father and brought them to the
cave. The time came when, at the signal from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
boy, the farmers assembled to take the outlaws unawares.
Gathering at the entrance of the side cave in
great <i>Surtshellir</i> in large numbers they slew all of the
outlaws except <i>Eyrik</i>. This man was the strongest of
all men of his time and made a stout resistance. However,
the farmers hacked at him with their swords and
cut off both feet at the ankles and both hands at the
wrists. Having no way in which to longer defend himself,
<i>Eyrik</i> turned a cartwheel on his bloody stumps
across the blistered lava, up the ice slope and to the
very summit of the glacier. In this manner he escaped
and if you doubt it you can still see the blood red
crags of fire scorched lava over which he rolled a
human wheel. He is, if this story is true, the only man
who has ever gained the summit of this, the second
mountain in height in Iceland and from him the mountain
takes its name.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we came upon the great <i>Hallmundarhraun</i>,
Hallmundar’s-Lava, twisted, crumpled,
cracked and tangled, grey with lichens and Icelandic
moss in patches and alive with ptarmigan, plover and
whimbrels. Beneath this lava sheet is <i>Surtshellir</i>, Surtur’s-Cave.
Before we explore this chamber of fire
origin it is well to pause for a moment and glance at
the Norse mythology relative to <i>Surtur</i>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Edda</i> of <i>Saemund</i>, the Wise, we find the
“Song of <i>Vafthruðnis</i>.” This is a dialog between <i>Odin</i>,
who, under the disguise of <i>Ganrade</i>, visited the <i>Jötunori</i>
to converse with their gigantic chief <i>Vafthruðnis</i>,
to determine which was the wiser. Their discourse was
concerning the origin of the world and the races of
men. When <i>Odin</i> entered the giant’s hall he was accosted
by the master as follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What mortal he who dares to come,</div>

<div class="verse">Unless he happly should exceed,</div>
<div class="verse">What wisdom is to me decreed.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After a lengthy and interesting dialog, <i>Odin</i> proposes
a question which the giant can not answer, so
<i>Vafthruðnis</i> replies:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>In this Ode we are told that <i>Surtur</i> was the adversary
of <i>Odin</i>, that he dwelt in the Antarctic,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<p class="noindent">This was on the fabled plain of <i>Vigriði</i>, where “a hundred
miles around” on the wreck of the fiery elements
the gods battled with their enemies and with the enemies
of the mortals whom they protected. One article
of the Norse mythology states that <i>Surtur</i>, the black
prince of the nether regions, should come from the
south and set the world on fire. Here where the devastation
of volcanic fire blast is terrible, where a whole valley
is filled with the scorched and blistered lava flow from
the ice-crowned volcanoes, here where the great, black
cavern extends for a mile under ground, the early settlers
located the abode of the dread black prince,
<i>Surtur</i>, and most fittingly. It was with a knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
of this cave in his mind that Jules Verne wrote his
story of “A Journey to the Center of the Earth.”</p>

<p>Beside the entrance and on a mound of crumpled
lava stands a <i>varða</i>, cairn, to mark the way. Hundreds
of these cairns have been built in the past centuries
throughout the travelled portions of Iceland to
guide the traveller over the mountain passes, across the
sandy deserts and extensive wastes of glacial moraine
as well as to point the direction to places where grass
may be found for the ponies. There is a style in Icelandic
cairns as in women’s clothes and one can tell
by their outward appearance at what period they were
built. They reminded <i>Henderson</i> of the passage in
Jeremiah xxxi, 21,—“Set thee up way-marks, make
thee high heaps.”</p>

<p>A portion of the roof of the cavern fell in at some
remote period and this is the entrance. We climbed
down with some difficulty to the snow bank and found
a ptarmigan perched upon a block of stone. I had no
difficulty in approaching within ten feet and she waited
for me to take two photographs. This is the largest
and the longest lava tunnel known. It is not, by any
means the largest cave, but the largest underground
passage by which lava formerly flowed that has been
explored. It was formed by the lava filling the floor
of the valley and cooling on top and then draining out
underneath to some lower level. It was in exactly this
same manner that the great lava flow came down from
<i>Skjalbreith</i>, filled <i>Thingvellir</i> and then drained out and
left the great plain between the mountains to fall to
form that wonderful formation previously described
in chapter six.</p>

<p>Vergil says,—“<i>facilis descensus Averno</i>” but we did
not find it easy to descend into the <i>Averno</i> of <i>Surtur</i>,
nor to follow the cavern once we had made the descent.
We purchased candles at <i>Akureyri</i> for this purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
and lighting them we entered the chamber with one in
each hand; there being three of us we had six candle
power. “How far that little candle throws his beams,”
of Shakespeare, was all too short a distance in this
blackness. A little beyond the entrance is a side passage
which we entered and where we found hundreds
of bones of sheep and horses. This was the place formerly
occupied by the above mentioned outlaws and thus
far the legend above related is a truth. There being
no animals in Iceland large enough to carry flesh into
this corner it is clear that they were taken here by
the hand of man. There are many hundreds of them
showing what an extensive use was made of the retreat
in the old days. Henderson mentions them in 1817
and Olafsen and Povelsen found them in 1753 so there
is no doubt of their great age and we may justly conclude
that these bones are those left by the outlaws.
As I write I have two of them before me, one a
vertebra of a sheep and the other a rib of a pony.
This rib had been broken while the horse was living
and had been healed again as the callosity testifies.
As I look at this ancient bone I often wonder what a
story it could relate of the cave where it has rested
these hundreds of years and of the deeds of that lawless
age.</p>

<p>For the first quarter of a mile the floor of the cave
is strewn with great basaltic plinths that have fallen
from the roof from time to time. Each stone was
damp, dripping wet or coated with ice from the water
that has percolated through the roof. The blocks
were so large that in climbing over them we frequently
found ourselves in holes up to the waist and as our
candles gave only a baleful glimmer it was difficult
to make progress. One can not step down into these
holes without first assuring himself where the bottom
is. Once down he must crawl up over the slippery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
stones on the opposite side.</p>

<p>The cavern runs straight as if laid out with a theodolite
and the roof is arched with plinths and the
walls are covered in places with patches of lava stalactites,
which spread their nets of lace-like lava in strange
fantastic forms. The dome is from forty to sixty feet
high and the cavern is about thirty feet in width. As
we proceeded we found more and more the deficiency
of our candles in giving sufficient light for us to take
advantage of the way, if indeed there is any advantage
of one place over another.</p>

<p>After a weary climb over the slippery rocks we came
to the reaches of ice, the accumulations of water that
seep through the vault. Here the roof is hung with
ice stalactites that often extend from the dome to the
floor and present a wonderful sight, for the light of the
candles, which refused to reflect from the blackened
walls, glitters and plays on the ice in a beautiful manner.
Great stalagmites of ice stand out of the murky
gloom like spectres of the departed outlaws who
haunted these underground chambers in the ancient
day of Iceland’s lawlessness. We fastened the candles
in the top of these huge white candlesticks and made
a flashlight of the ice wall before us, which had brought
us to an abrupt stop and where the journeys of most of
the tourists end. The vapor hung heavily in the freezing
air and the smoke from the candle flame, in the
absolute quiet of the air, hung suspended or twined in
long, curling bands of moisture laden smoke, which
assumed fantastic forms, reminding us of the wraiths
that disturb the midnight slumbers of guilty dreamers
in the castle-haunted dungeons of mediaeval days.</p>

<p>At first it seemed impossible for us to scale the ice
wall with any means at our disposal but by dint of much
exertion it was accomplished. We knew that Povelsen
in his visit and later Henderson, had deposited coins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
in the cairns which Povelsen had built at the far end
of this cave. We had brought with us two Lincoln
cents of the date of 1910 for the express purpose of
placing them in the cairn. Ólafur ascended on my
shoulders and gripping the lava stalactites on the wall
managed to ascend. With his feet engaged in the
crevices of the wall, he reached down and drew up Mrs.
Russell, who stood on my shoulders. The two then
formed a living chain by which I climbed to the top
of the ice. Under the ice wall there was some water
but the passage was too long and the ice columns too
near together for a passage in this direction. Once on
the top the way became easier. The ice sloped in a
gentle declivity to the floor of the tunnel and when we
left it we found a continuation of the heavy blocks of
stone for some distance. This was followed by finer
material and eventually by sand which made the walking
much better. At the end of an hour of hard labor
we arrived at the end of the tunnel and found the ancient
cairn. We removed the capstone and with the wax
of our candles cemented the two Lincoln cents, left our
cards, replaced the capstone and retraced our weary
way.</p>

<p>The return was as arduous as the inward journey, for
we had slipped over the icy rocks and into the holes so
often that our woolen gloves were cut to threads and
our boots still show the scars of those ignominious
slides. Nowhere else in Iceland have I ever felt the
least fear of danger, neither in fording the glacial rivers,
in the terrible deserts, on the ice mountains, nor in sleeping
in the crater of <i>Askja</i>, Bowl, with ice beside my
tent and columns of steam and sulfur gases rising from
the solfatara in front, but, in this cave the thought was
ever present with me,—“those blocks of stone, some of
them weighing a ton, each has fallen from that lofty
dome, when will the next one fall?” The experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
was worth all the labor for we had been in the actual
home of the outlaws, had worked our way to the far end
of the longest and grandest lava tunnel known, we had
seen the beautiful ice barrier, beautiful as the altar
screen in the great cathedrals of Europe and we had
left positive proof of our labor in the ancient cairn.
No one should omit this visit if he is near this portion
of Iceland. When he has issued from the darkness
into the sunlight, if he desires more of the same
experience he will find a similar tunnel not far from
<i>Surtshellir</i>, which was discovered in 1909.</p>

<p>That night we reached <i>Kalmungstúnga</i>, a prosperous
farm within the shadows of <i>Geitlands Jökull</i>, Goat-Land,
and <i>Ök Jökull</i>, Yoke. This is a new farm house
with spacious and airy rooms and well furnished. The
farmer is obliging though he has a reputation of overcharging
his guests. After a well cooked dinner we
repaired to rest, not having slept more than three
hours out of the last forty-eight. A little after midnight
I was aroused by Mrs. Russell, who was saying:—</p>

<p>“There is some one in our room.”</p>

<p>After a little I awoke sufficiently to see a man standing
at the foot of the bed occupied by Mrs. Russell. I
asked,—</p>

<p>“Who is there and what is wanted?”</p>

<p>“It is Ólafur. The Governor of Iceland with his
daughter has arrived and he wishes a bed,” replied
the guide.</p>

<p>“Well, let him have one if he can find it. We are
too tired to give up these.”</p>

<p>“The farmer does not want them, but there is one
folded up under your bed. If I can get it the Governor
will have it set up in the hall and sleep there.”</p>

<p>So saying, he took away the bed and we were soon
asleep and did not awaken till the Governor sent word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
to us at ten in the morning that he would like our company
at breakfast. The farmer’s wife prepared a
special breakfast, cooking a young lamb. The good
wife brought our her best dishes and loaded the table
with her choicest food, for even in Iceland, it is not
every morning that the Governor takes breakfast with
the peasants.</p>

<p>The farmer at <i>Kalmungstúnga</i>, in former days, was
accused by English writers of overcharging travellers.
In comparison with other Icelandic rates it must be
stated that there is still some truth in the assertion.
However, he is enterprising, has built a fine large house
with many arrangements for comfort and all his supplies
have to be transported from the coast on the
backs of the ponies. These things are expensive. If
the traveller enjoys unusual comfort here or elsewhere
in Iceland it is no more than common justness that he
should pay unusual prices for his accommodation. On
this farm there has recently been constructed a reinforced
concrete stable, spacious enough for housing
500 sheep besides numerous horses and cows. The
Governor pointed out to me the signs of prosperity
while we were saddling the ponies and stated that more
of the farmers might do as well if they had the enterprise.
I might say with reference to our own bill at
this farm that it was moderate but this is possibly due
to the fact that I had been of some assistance in treating
one of his favorite ponies that had a bad saddle gall
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>It was one in the afternoon when we parted with
the Governor to meet him some days later in his beautiful
home in <i>Reykjavik</i>. We then rode down the
green slope, and through the birch copse to the river,
which we found easily fordable, though it has a bad
reputation. Looking up from the hayfield, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
harvest in the full gathering, with men and women
busy, the ice-crowned pyramids stand,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“Like giants clad in armor blue,</div>
<div class="verse">With helmets of a silver hue.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This view is of great interest and beauty and I gazed
longingly to the peaks that enclose <i>Thórisdalr</i>, Thief’s-Dale,
and desired to climb those ridges of tumbled moraine
and examine that great wall of eternal ice that
hangs above. The lack of sufficient time made it impossible.
This pleasure was experienced in 1913 when
I came into <i>Kaldidalr</i>, Cold-Valley from the opposite
direction, having pitched my camp at <i>Brunnar</i>, Springs,
for several days. This view from <i>Kalmungstúnga</i>
leaves no doubt in the mind of the traveller that he is
in the land of <i>ice</i>; but when he turns towards the west,
passes into the green valley of the <i>Hvitá</i> and comes into
close proximity with the numerous hot springs scattered
over the plains and along the banks of the river
a more temperate climate is suggested.</p>

<p>Having crossed the <i>Geitlandsá</i>, Goat-River, we followed
it down to the <i>Barnafoss</i>, Child-Falls, so named
because of the drowning of some children at this place
by accident. Some guide books call these falls the
<i>Geitlandsáfoss</i>, Goat-River-Falls. In ancient times,
when places were named in Iceland there must have
been many goats in various portions of the country for
we came across the name in various places; thus there
are several “goat” mountains, “goat” gullies, “goat”
rivers, etc. Personally I have seen one flock of goats
only in the entire range of my travels and that was near
<i>Ljósavatn</i>. The explanation is that they will not stand
the wet climate as well as the sheep. When the cold
driving rains sweep down the mountain slopes the
goats run to shelter while the sheep will continue their
feeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>At these falls the water, in a series of three strong
leaps, drops over one hundred feet into the canyon.
The rock formation at this point is of interest to the geologist,
for there is a large mass of metamorphosed obsidian.
It is the only rock formation of this character
that I have ever witnessed, either in position or as
samples in a collection of minerals and rocks in science
museums. An examination of this formation leads
to the following conclusion. In an early eruption a
large mass of obsidian was formed at this place. During
a more recent lava flow the heat of the adjacent
flowing rock rendered this mass of obsidian plastic;
this caused it to stick to the passing lava stream, like
molten glass, and it was thus pulled, twisted and
stretched into its present shape.</p>

<p>This is a lovely series of <i>fosses</i>. The water from
the rapidly melting glaciers pours out of the narrow
confines of the basaltic canyon and at the foot of each
fall forms a grand basin of emerald green water in a
weird rock setting. Towards <i>Kalmungstúnga</i> there is a
good sized forest, for Iceland, and the grass plains,
through which this canyon cuts a great gray gash, form
a real oasis in this elevated lava waste, shut in by towering
mountains capped eternally with adamantine ice.</p>

<p>But by far the greatest interest here is the series of
waterfalls, at the foot of the <i>Barnafoss</i>, which pour
out of the lava in a half-mile series of cascades and waterspouts.
North of <i>Kalmungstúnga</i> the waters from
<i>Eyriks Jökull</i> flow into the lava and doubtless into subterranean
channels like the tunnel of <i>Surtshellir</i>. This
river flows many miles under ground and reappears
at this point beside the brink of the <i>Hvitá</i> canyon. The
rock formation which makes this strange waterfall possible
is as follows:—</p>

<p>A rift in the ancient basalt, doubtless the result of an
earthquake, formed the canyon of the <i>Geitlandsá</i>; later,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
another flow of lava swept down the valley and stopped
at the very brink of this rift so that two great lava
flows stand in sight, one above the other. Between
these two sheets of lava flows the lost river from the
glaciers and here it spurts out in a long series of cascades
side by side. It is one of the finest sights in
Iceland and one that the traveller in Iceland usually
misses because it is off the regular trail. The guides
do not always call attention to it and I fear that many
of them do not know of its existence. It is a fact that
few Icelanders know their own country, even the portion
of it which they sometimes attempt to show to
tourists. There are a few guides who know the travelled
portion and know it thoroughly; these men look
askance upon their fellows who act as guides and do
not know every detail of the route, its history and its
legends. The real Icelandic guide will, if you encourage
him the least bit, show every point of interest
and relate all the history and the legends. A story is
told by the guides at <i>Reykjavik</i> of one of their fellow
countrymen who attempted to guide a man from <i>Geysir</i>
to <i>Gullfoss</i>, a distance of from one and a half to two
hours ride. After wandering about the country all day
and a part of the night they returned to <i>Geysir</i> without
having seen the falls. He will never hear the end
of it in <i>Reykjavik</i>. We have Ólafur to thank for
many profitable hours in his beloved land. The real
guide loves every spot to which he takes you and he
feels that there is nothing like it, nothing half so good
anywhere else in the world. The enthusiastic guide,
filled with the love of his country and steeped in its
traditions is a boon to a traveller, no matter in what
land he seeks new scenes.</p>

<p>It was late when we left the falls and so we hastened
across the rolling, grass-grown hills to <i>Reykholt</i>, Steam-Stead.
Down the long slope and across the usual grass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
bog we rode and into the enclosure by the house where
we were welcomed and given comfortable quarters by
the pastor. This is historic ground, the site of the
stead of <i>Snorri Sturlason</i>, “The Herodotus of the
north.”</p>

<p>Snorri was born in 1178, when only three years of
age he went to fostering at the home of <i>Saemund</i>, the
Wise, at <i>Oddi</i>. <i>Saemund</i> died when Snorri was nineteen.
Snorri’s father had considerable property but
after his death, Snorri’s mother, described as a “gay
young widow” wasted the substance and left the son
to enter life’s activities with little. In 1199 Snorri
married the daughter of <i>Bersi</i>, the Wealthy, who lived
at <i>Borg</i>, the home of the famous <i>Skallagrim</i>. Snorri
was now twenty years old and he entered directly into
public affairs. He early became embroiled in partisan
feuds but continued to gain power and following. This
lead to his attaining the position of the <i>Goði</i> of his district.
The <i>Goði</i> was a priestly ruler whose power and
influence was supreme. If one desires to know more of
the life and functions of this ancient official of the early
days of Iceland he can get no better account than that
left in the writings of Snorri.</p>

<p>Snorri at this time obtained the stead of <i>Reykholt</i> as
a freehold and at once separated from his wife. The
date of this occurrence is prior to 1209 for we read
that the Bishop of <i>Hólar</i> spent the “winter of 1209
at <i>Reykholt</i> with <i>Snorri Sturlason</i>.” He had thus won
the choicest holding in the entire valley as well as the
enviable position of <i>Goði</i>. “He now became a great
chieftain with ample means.” In 1215 he was elected
Speaker-at-Law, at the early age of thirty-seven and for
a term of three years. This was the highest honor in
the land.</p>

<p>Snorri was a statesman, a poet, a scholar and a historian.
It is in the latter capacity that he is of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
interest to us. In 1218 he went to Norway and was
made a welcome guest at the homes of several of the
Earls and at the court of King <i>Hakon</i> on account of his
winning ways, his ready wit, his commanding presence
and the songs that he composed in honor of his friends.
He tarried two winters in Norway and it was during the
second winter that his love of wealth and power was
used by the King as a lever to influence him to betray
Iceland into the hands of the Norwegian monarch.
Snorri and his warlike brothers had often been embroiled
in feuds especially with the masters of the trading
ships from Norway and from Orkney. From his
position as <i>Goði</i>, Snorri had the power to fix the prices
and he often took advantage of his power to enrich
himself at the expense of the foreigners. The result
of these troubles was that an armed expedition was to
be sent to Iceland by the orders of King <i>Hakon</i> under
the conduct of Earle <i>Skuli</i> to avenge their countrymen
who had been put to death in Iceland. Snorri knew
what would be the outcome of this expedition, how it
would develop into a long and hostile strife between
the two countries and with most persuasive language
he assuaged the anger of the King and his Earle and
held out prospects that Icelanders might become the
vassals of <i>Hakon</i>. This suited the King, so Snorri
was made a “landed-man,” the highest position to which
one of the King’s subjects could be elevated. Snorri,
as a vassal, immediately gave to the King all of his
great estates in Iceland. The King immediately returned
them all to Snorri as his “landed-man” and in
the form of a Royal Grant. This swapping for an
empty title was the greatest mistake of Snorri’s life,
and one that eventually led to his premature death.
The Icelanders never knew the real reason for this act
and they could bear no treason. Snorri, with all
of his shrewdness, did not forsee the outcome. In 1220
he returned to Iceland with great gifts from both Earle
and King. When he landed in the Westmann Islands
in pomp the people became suspicious of him and made
slurring jests about him even making parodies upon
his own poems which cut Snorri to the quick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>But he recovered his power and again won the confidence
and esteem of nearly all of the people and in
1222 they again made him Speaker for the second time.
It is quite probable that Snorri repented of his plan to
betray Iceland to Norway and we know that his excuse
was to save Iceland from immediate invasion. It is
to be regretted that Icelanders did not fully understand
his reason. Most of Snorri’s troubles came from feudal
strife with his own relatives, especially his nephew,
<i>Sturla</i>. At one time this ungrateful nephew appropriated
all of his uncle’s estates in <i>Borg</i> and endeavored
to make himself the mighty man of Iceland. We can
not enter into the long conflict, how the people took
sides with both parties, how a thousand armed men
marched down on peaceful <i>Borg</i>, how Snorri in sorrow
returned to Norway, tarried awhile and then came back
to his home in <i>Borg</i> only to meet death in the cellar
of his own house. It may all be read in the story written
by his nephew, <i>Sturla Thordson</i>.</p>

<p>Snorri was a man of peaceful disposition, avoiding
arms when arbitration could be employed, a man of
business but not a man of action as men were active in
his day. He did not choose the turmoil of political
strife into which he was drawn. It was love of wealth
and vanity that led to his weakness at the court of
<i>Hakon</i> and which was misunderstood in Iceland and
which gave his enemies an opportunity. This was the
one great mistake of his life and he endeavored to
atone for the weakness, but his enemies, though they
never knew the full story of this affair, never forgave
him. He paid for his error by being hewn to pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
in the cellar of his home at <i>Reykholt</i> on September
22, 1241. The mound of the great house that was
pulled down upon his remains has never been disturbed
and the beautiful marguerites have bloomed above it for
centuries.</p>

<p>As a historian Snorri will always hold high rank.
The <i>Heimskringla</i>, the Story of the Kings of Norway,
is a faithful picture of the times, impartial, straightforward,—it
is the story and not the historian that the
reader has before him when he opens these pages.
Only once in that long history is there any comment
by the author. There is none of the so called “philosophy
of history” which has fogged so many historical
pages that have been written in modern days. Writers
may well take a lesson from Snorri, who “<i>let facts deliver
the verdict</i>, keeping his own judgment to himself.”
Here in the dale of <i>Reykholt</i>, beside his steaming
springs and with his flocks and herds about him, Snorri
writes of the great kings of Norway, of their wars and
their wanderings, their labors for Christianity and the
uplifting of their subjects. He bears us away to Scotland
and to England and often to Ireland, we learn
of the correspondence with the Emperor Frederick and
King Louis of France, we learn of James of Aragon,
of William the Conqueror and Alphonse of Castile,—he
takes us to far away Algeria, to Tunis and to Greece,
to Venice and Constantinople and to holy Jerusalem.
In 1300 he was described as “a man to our knowledge
most wise and fair-minded.”</p>

<p>Snorri’s language is simple, yet dignified, clear in
thought and vivid in the picture portrayed and in
scenes described. His sentences are short and graphic,
clear and concise. His dialogs are frequent and to
the point. Silence, where it is sure to arouse the interest
of the reader, is artfully employed as is shown
in the kidnapping of <i>Harek</i> and in the mysterious loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
of two of King <i>Olaf’s</i> ships at <i>Faroe</i>. In humor, also,
Snorri is a master and brings into his story bits of mirth
and wit that make his pages sparkle and give point to
the story he is writing. Witness the good wife who objected
to the King’s using the middle of the towel in
the morning to wipe his face when he should have used
the lower end in the morning, the middle at noon and
the top at night, thus saving her two towels. His wit
and his stories give point to his writings and will insure
their life as long as people love to dwell upon the
customs of their predecessors. Impartial, faithful,
clear, Snorri brings the story of the ancient times
among the Norsemen down to his own day, weaving
into his warp the threads of fact that bound the Viking
to the British Isles, the sunny Mediterranean and the
Holy Land as well as to his beloved Iceland. He has
erected for himself an enduring monument.</p>

<p>It is a tumbled mound, this grass-grown pile at
<i>Reykholt</i>, but it is all that is left of Snorri’s stately
manor. In the quiet of the evening I stood upon the
heap, and the past of Iceland’s history rushed before
me, its long Viking period, the coming of the Cross and
the troublesome times that followed; in the story of
Snorri I had learned of Norway’s ancient days and
Iceland’s matchless heroes. It is the same quiet
meadow at my feet and the same blue ridge in the distance
that met the gaze of Snorri, the people are the
same in race and customs but in other things how
changed. The Cross has wrought its full influence.
Were this mound in other lands the spade would long
since have explored its recesses in search of relics and
mementoes of this great man. It is sacred to the Icelander
and has never been disturbed.</p>

<p>Beside the mound is <i>Snorrilaug</i>, Snorri’s Bath. Next
to the <i>Heimskringla</i> the bath is his greatest monument
and serves better to perpetuate the memory of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Sage of <i>Reykholt</i> than any thing that other hands
could have wrought. It is circular in form, fifteen feet
in diameter and constructed of split stones which were
fitted in an exact manner and joined by means of a
cement made on the spot by Snorri himself out of the
pulverized geyserite. The floor of the bath is of split
tufa and cemented with care. A stone bench, capable
of seating thirty persons is built around the inside of
the bath with the wall for a back. A hot spring, called
<i>Scribla</i>, is located 500 feet from the bath and from
<i>Scribla</i> to the bath Snorri constructed an underground
passage out of stones all carefully cemented together.
In 1733 this conduit was shaken by an earthquake and
the Rev. Finn Jonson, Bishop of <i>Skálholt</i>, repaired
it. Aside from this incident, the bath stands to-day as
when Snorri was killed beside it. The steps from his
house led directly down into the bath. It is a masterpiece
of work that remains intact after the centuries
so that one may turn on the hot water from <i>Scribla</i>
and use it to-day as did Snorri during the first half of
the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>The valley of <i>Reykholt</i> contains many excellent hot
springs, some of which have lost part of their former
power and do not spout because of the disarrangement
of their tubes by recent earthquakes. On a quiet day
steam rises from many places in the valley and along
the banks of the river. There is one spring of unique
formation and peculiar in its situation, the <i>Áhver</i>,
River-Hot-Spring. It is in the middle of the river that
divides the valley. The river is broad but shallow
and the water is cold. In the middle of the stream
rises the mound of the hot spring several feet above
the water. This mound contains three orifices out of
which boiling water pours vigorously. We waded out
to this hot mound and climbed to the top. There is
no danger of being scalded because the springs no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
longer spout as in former days on account of the before
mentioned earthquake, which has disturbed the
tubes. In place of the former periodical spouts of
hot water there is now a continuous flow in which the
water rises one or two feet above the mouth of the
tubes and escapes with much spluttering and accompanied
with large volumes of steam. These tubes are
a foot or more in diameter. It is a singular location
for a hot spring but there is another phenomenon even
more surprising. Below the mound of geyserite in the
channel of the river there is a long series of holes in
the river bed out of which boiling water spurts with
such violence in places as to eject steam up through the
cold water. Our ponies in fording this stream were
quite shy of these hot holes in the bed of the river and
insisted on going far down stream.</p>

<p>The valley is rich in grass, with many fine herds of
cattle and flocks of sheep. It was one of these rich
pasture lands at the foot of the snowy mountains, in
Iceland that led Henderson, who realized how dependent
was the farmer upon the grass, to quote from
Proverbs as follows:—</p>

<p>“Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks
and look well to thy herds; for riches are not forever,
nor doth the crown endure to every generation. The
hay appeareth and the tender grass showeth itself, and
the herbs of the mountains are gathered. The lambs
are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of thy
field. And thou shalt have goat’s milk enough for thy
food, for the food of thy household and for the maintenance
of thy maidens.”</p>

<p>Yes, Iceland, the grass is thine and the flocks are
thine. Nature has cruelly deprived thee of mines and
forests, of warmth for cultivating thy rich soil; but
she has peopled thee with a noble race, cradled amidst
thy fire-born hills which are crowned with everlasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
ice. She has given to thee sufficient grass for thy numerous
flocks that thou mayest be clothed and fed. An
Arctic ocean “laves the feet of the White Lady” and
its every billow teems with the choicest of fish. In
exchange for these the merchant brings to thy marts
those products of modern life which Europe calls necessities
but which to thee are luxuries.</p>

<p>A land of wonder is thy birthright, marvellously
wrought by fire and ice. It appeals to him who four
times has visited thy shore and has explored the inmost
recesses of thy deserts, it appealed to thy ancestors
ten centuries since as a haven of liberty; mightily it
appeals to thee to-day. Thy sons upon Dakota’s
plains, thy daughters by the Winnipeg,—truants from
thy hallowed dales and sloping greens,—oft feel the
wrenching of the heartstrings and oft turn back to fatherland
and home. Thy thousand years and more of
warfare with the elements and thine own internal
strife, thy centuries of thraldom to priestly power and
greed of foreign merchant, thy years of famine and
devastation by shaking earth and burning mountain
have left their mark deep graven in thy forehead. But,—Thou
art FREE. Before thee the future opens with
promise her ever widening portals, a promise radiant
as the bow of <i>Baldar</i> which oft spans thy misty vales.
Let not internal strife, the copying of foreign fashions
and the jealousy of prospering neighbor be thy undoing.
Out of the terrible past hast thou come with many
a reprimand and many a sign to point the way which
thou shouldst go, as plainly as thy <i>varðr</i> guide the fog-bound
traveller upon thy mountain moors.</p>

<p>If a foreigner, who has long studied the factors of
thy problem and knows something from experience of
thy living struggle, may offer advice and not offend,—it
would be the quoted wisdom of Solomon:—</p>

<p>“<i>Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks</i>,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and then the words of the poet will be thy experience:—</p>

THE SUN SHINES.”</p>

<p class="tb"><a href="#Page_82">Page 82</a>,—<i>Family Names</i>:—The system of nomenclature
given in Chapter VII is the prevailing
one, still there are a <i>few</i> family names in Iceland. This
is due to settlers from foreign lands, who have kept
their family names and bequeathed them to their children.
As an illustration I mention the <i>Zoëga</i> family,
which, if my informant is correct, came from Italy
many years ago.</p>

<p class="tb"><a href="#Page_84">Page 84</a>,—<i>Kárastaðir</i>:—Possibly a more probable
derivation of this name lies in the fact that in the
early days of the settlement of this portion of the
country one of the settlers bore this name, <i>Kára</i>. Thus it
should be translated, the stead or the farm of <i>Kára</i>.</p>

<p class="tb"><a href="#Page_89">Page 89</a>,—<i>Öxerá</i>:—It was not till the summer of
1913, a year after Chapter VII was written, that I
learned a most interesting thing about this river so famous
in Icelandic history. It seems that in ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
days the river followed a natural channel near the
ridge that rises above the heath near <i>Kárastaðir</i>. It
did not enter the lake, <i>Thingvallavatn</i>, by the way of
<i>Almannagjá</i> as it does to-day.</p>

<p>The Vikings dispatched <i>Geitskour</i> in 965 throughout
the country to choose a suitable place for the meeting
of the <i>Althing</i>. After a summer of travel he chose
this sunken valley and named it <i>Thingvallir</i>. The Vikings
then turned the river from its ancient bed and
caused it to tumble into this rift. What joy there must
have been in the hearts of those sturdy old fellows as
they stood on the opposite wall and watched the torrent
make its first plunge into the abyss! Hence <i>Axe
River</i>, the river whose channel was fashioned by their
axes.</p>

<p class="tb"><a href="#Page_92">Page 92</a>,—<i>Measuring Stone</i>:—Various authors
have perpetuated the story of this peculiar stone,
as given in Chapter VII, that stands in the church
yard at <i>Thingvellir</i>. They tell us, and so do the guides,
that it was the standard of measurement adopted by
an ancient <i>Althing</i>, from which all linear measures in
the country were taken.</p>

<p>Since writing Chapter VII, I have had another opportunity,
in 1913, to examine this stone with more
care. I emphatically state that it was not made by the
hand of man and that the so-called “measuring marks”
on it are nothing but steam holes blown through it by
the great pressure when the stone was molten and cooling.
The stone has been split open and the marks have
the appearance of having been placed there by man.
To further substantiate this I would refer to the fact
that in 1913 Mr. J. C. Angus of York, England, and
myself saw numerous blocks of lava in various places
at <i>Mývatn</i> with identical markings. Mr. Angus fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
agrees with me in the above statement about the “measuring
stone.”</p>

<p>Further, if the people who examine this stone in
the future will go around it, examine it on all sides and
near the ground they will find actual holes that penetrate
deeply into the stone in several places. These
have evidently escaped the eyes of those who like to
point to this as the “first standard of linear measurement
ever prepared by the people of northern Europe.”
It is a pretty story and affords the guides a lot of
amusement,—but <i>facts are facts</i>.</p>

<p class="tb"><a href="#Page_104">Page 104</a>,—<i>Brúará</i>:—There is another story differing
from the one I gave in Chapter VIII, though
that one is correct, relative to the way in which this
river received its name of Bridge River. In the old
days there was a natural lava arch spanning the stream
just below the site of the present bridge. The story
relates that a woman on the side of the river nearest
to <i>Geysir</i> was widely known for her hospitality. In
those days it was the custom of the people to go “guesting”
in the autumn and stay until spring. The <i>Sagas</i>
are replete with such incidents.</p>

<p>At length this good lady became weary because of
the large number of her uninvited guests from across
the river. She dispatched two of her thralls in the
autumn to break down the lava arch. This they did
but they both lost their lives in the flood when the arch
fell. The natural arch gave this stream the name of
Bridge River. The illustration facing page 114 was
taken from the present bridge.</p>

<p class="tb"><a href="#Page_134">Page 134</a>,—<i>Galtalaekur</i>:—During the severe earthquake
that preceded the eruption of <i>Hekla</i> in the
latter part of April 1913 these ancient buildings
were entirely demolished. It was one of the oldest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Icelandic turf houses. It has sheltered nearly all the
people who have ascended <i>Hekla</i> for many generations.</p>

<p class="tb"><a href="#Page_215">Page 215</a>,—<i>Skútustaðir</i>:—This should be derived,
not from the Icelandic <i>skúti</i>, cave, but from an
old Viking who settled here by the name of <i>Skúti</i>. I
am indebted for this correction to Thorður Floventsson
of <i>Svatákot</i>.</p>

<p class="tb"><a href="#Page_216">Page 216</a>,—<i>Kraká</i>:—This word is more correctly
derived from the Icelandic <i>Kraká</i>, the name of a witch.
In Chapter XIII I derived it from <i>kraki</i>, crow or raven.
The following story was related to me in 1913,
while struggling along its boggy margin by my guide,
Ólafur Eyvindsson.</p>

<p>“There was a witch by the name of <i>Kraká</i> who lived
in the mountains up the valley. She became angry with
a farmer over a piece of fine meadow land which he
refused to convey to her under any condition. Thereupon
she threatened to destroy it if he did not yield at
once. He remained obstinate. Soon a river poured
out from the mountains, laid waste the farm and flooded
the great meadow, as may be seen to this day, especially
if the traveller goes from <i>Skútustaðir</i> to
<i>Svatákot</i>, Black-River-Farm, as we are now doing. In
this instance his route will be across <i>Graenavatn</i>, Green-Lake.”</p>

<p><i>Graenavatn</i> is a mighty meadow with water over all
of it, but so shallow that the grass stands in most places
out of the water. It is only along the edge of the
river, <i>Kraká</i>, where the water has thrown up the black
sand, that it is possible for ponies to proceed.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>Railway</i>:—I have seen several paragraphs going
the rounds of the American press relative to a railroad
in Iceland. I had a chance to ride on this railroad in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
1913. It is less than two miles in length. It is merely
an improvised affair to transport rocks from the quarry
to the two great breakwaters that are being built to
protect the harbor of <i>Reykjavik</i>.</p>

<p>There is some discussion in the <i>Althing</i>, (winter of
1914,) about the construction of a railway from <i>Reykjavik</i>
into the rich grazing land near <i>Eyrarbakki</i>. At
the present writing nothing definite has been done. It
seems that it would be unwise to employ steam and ship
the coal from Scotland, when an electric road can be
made much more cheaply and there is such an abundance
of water power for electricity.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
